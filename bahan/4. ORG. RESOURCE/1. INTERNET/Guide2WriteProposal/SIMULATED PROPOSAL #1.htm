DESCRIPTION</FONT></B></P>
<P>A community-based mothers and infants center called "Healthy Moms for Healthy 
Kids" (Pusat Ibu dan Anak Sihat or PIAS) will be established in Kota Emessu, the 
city surrounding the Universitas Pembangunan Pertanian (UNPEMPER). PIAS will 
focus on providing nutritional education and counseling for mothers, especially 
those from the extremely low income areas. It is expected that through the 
providing of information to the mothers that it will be possible to have a 
direct and positive effect on the well being of the young children of the 
community. 
<P>PIAS will utilize volunteers who are students at UNPEMPER. Each student will 
be expected to successfully participate in a 4 week training program at the 
beginning of their work with PIAS. This training program will provide basic 
nutritional information for mothers and information on adult teaching methods. 
Student volunteers who demonstrate proficiency during the initial training 
program will be invited to participate in an advanced training program to learn 
effective nutritional counseling techniques. Each student volunteer will be 
expected to contribute 3-5 hours each week and to continue with PIAS for a 
period of not less than 6 months. 
<P>PIAS will operate with 6 full and part time staff members. In addition, a 
Governing Board made up of community leaders and university staff will operate 
to provide overall sanctioning of the Center's operation. Periodic evaluations 
will be conducted to assess the value of PIAS on a) helping the student 
volunteers to become effective educators, b) the development of new 
understandings on the part of local mothers and c) the improvement of the well 
being of children in Kota Emessu.</P>

<P><A name="BACKGROUND INFORMATION/STATEMENT OF PROBLEM"></A><B><FONT 
color=#008000>BACKGROUND INFORMATION/STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</FONT></B></P>
<P>Major obstacles to child survival in the developing world include infections, 
parasitic diseases, malnutrition and the risks associated with low birth weight 
and high fertility. (UN Informational Letter #37-435) A serious problem exists 
in the rural villages of Malnesia of children dying from common illness and 
infections that are attributable to poor nutrition. Though high nutrition foods 
are available in the villages, it is apparent that mothers do not have an 
understanding of exactly what foods contain the most value for their children. 
(Ministry of Health, 1994) The most significant person in the life of the young 
child is the child's mother. Research has shown that the children of mothers who 
have an understanding of how to provide good nutrition to their children stand a 
significantly greater chance of survival during the first three years of life 
(87% survival rate) as compared with children of mothers who do not know how to 
provide good nutrition (43% survival rate) (Position Paper, Opening Plenary 
Session, Malnesian Health Conference/MALHEALTHCON - 96).</P>
<P>The use of volunteers to provide community service is a new concept in 
Malnesia and can be capitalized upon as a viable way to provide trained manpower 
for the offering of educational services. The first student service scheme, 
Service Mahasiswa/SERMAH, was created in the early 1990s. Initially operated at 
only two universities, SERMAH is now a mandated national program that operates 
at all public and private universities (Directorate for Higher Education, 
Ministry of Education, Statistics for 1996). The emphasis of SERMAH has been 
exclusively on the providing of information to local farmers on improved farming 
practices. The Universitas Pembangunan Pertanian has been funded by the Ministry 
of Agriculture to operate the SERMAH Educational Development Center (Introducing 
SERMAH, Ministry of Agriculture, 1996) as a central agency for the providing of 
farming practices instructional materials to all universities in Malnesia. The 
selection and training of student volunteers is conducted autonomously at each 
university with the support of the instructional materials disseminated by the 
SERMAH Educational Development Center.</P>

PLAN</FONT></B></P>
<P>Project evaluation will be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator and 
consist of two different evaluative strategies - formative and summative.</P>
<UL>
  <P><B>Formative Evaluation</B> - Primarily qualitative in nature, the 
  formative evaluation will be conducted through interviews and open-ended 
  questionnaires. Mothers and student volunteers will be asked about the 
  day-to-day operation of the Center, the topics covered in the volunteer 
  training program, the attractiveness of the training materials, and other 
  questions to provide feedback for the ongoing improvement of the operation of 
  the Project. The Project Evaluator will meet regularly with project staff to 
  share findings from the formative evaluation effort. Periodic reports will be 
  prepared that identify the major findings of the formative evaluation and how 
  they have been used to improve Project operation.</P>
  <P><B>Summative Evaluation</B> - Primarily quantitative in nature, the 
  summative evaluation will begin with the establishment of baseline data at the 
  beginning of the Project (using a random sample of mothers of young children 
  to assess their food and nutrition knowledge) and then be conducted at 6 month 
  intervals (just prior to each group of volunteers completing their Project 
  service). Data for the summative evaluation will focus on the two primary 
  goals of the project and the objectives of each.<BR><BR>
  <UL><B>Goal #1</B><BR>
    <UL>- Pre/post tests of knowledge gain on the part of the mothers in 
      health and nutrition information (Objective 1.1).<BR>- Selected interviews 
      of mothers to assess their ability to effectively apply health and 
      nutrition information (Objective 1.2). <BR>- Selected interviews of 
      mothers to evaluate changes in the health of their child (Objective 
    1.3).</UL><BR><B>Goal #2</B><BR>
    <UL>- Records of number of students involved in the project (Objective 
      2.1). <BR>- Documentation of agendas/attendance rosters from all training 
      programs (Objective 2.1). <BR>- Documentation of number of mothers served 
      and number of volunteer hours recorded at the PIAS Center (Objective 2.3). 
      <BR>- Comparative analysis of Goal #2 data with similar data from SERMAH 
      (Objective 2.4)</UL></UL><BR>

<UL>
  <P><I>For the past 10 years I have had a strong concern for the health of 
  young children in the Kota Emessu area. This is the area in which I was born 
  and raised. Through my studies at the University and my practice as a teacher 
  and lecturer I have come to learn that it is possible to alleviate the 
  problems of malnutrition through well designed and meaningfully focused 
  educational programs. </I></P>
  <P><I>The challenge to the creation and operation of these programs, however, 
  is twofold. First, there does not exist the teaching materials to assist 
  mothers of young children in understanding how to improve nutritional intake 
  and the effect that nutritional intake has on the health and welfare of their 
  own children. And second, there does not exist a group of trained facilitators 
  to assist in delivering this information in a timely and meaningful 
  manner.</I></P>
  <P><I>Research suggests that the most powerful way to affect the health and 
  welfare of a young child is through the improved understanding of the child's 
  mother. This project will focus on the development of teaching materials and a 
  system for helping mothers of young children learn appropriate food and 
  nutrition information to help in the development of their children. And, it 
  will occur in a local community location, close to where these mothers of 
  young children are living.</I></P>
  <P><I>Further, the Project will build upon the very successful SERMAH program 
  as a way to involve university student volunteers in the offering of services 
  to mothers of young children. In addition to using these volunteers as a 
  viable form of manpower for the offering of service, the Project will work to 
  help these volunteers learn meaningful food/nutrition information and also 
  techniques for effectively teaching this information to adults - a knowledge 
  base that is certain to help them in their future endeavors.</I></P>
