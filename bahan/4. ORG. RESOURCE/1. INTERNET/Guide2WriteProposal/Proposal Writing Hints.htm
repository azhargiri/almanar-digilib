  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Check to see if the agency you have in mind has any specifications 
    for the Title Page (often they have a required format).<BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Usually the Title/Cover Page includes signatures of key people in 
    your organization (Department Head, Supervisor, Contracts Officer, 
    etc.).<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>If your proposal is 
    built on collaborating with other groups/organizations it is usually a good 
    idea to include their names on the Title/Cover Page.<BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Your cover 
    should look professional and neat. However, do not waste time using fancy 
    report covers, expensive binding, or other procedures that may send the 
    wrong message to the potential funding agency. You are trying to impress the 
    potential funding agency with how you really need funding, not the message 
    that you do things rather expensively!<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>The title should be 
    clear and unambiguous (do not make it "cute"). <BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Think of your 
    title as a mini-abstract. A good title should paint a quick picture for the 
    reader of the key idea(s) of your project. <BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>The words you use in 
    your title should clearly reflect the focus of your proposal. The most 
    important words should come first, then the less important words. Notice 
    that both of the following titles use basically the same words, except in a 
    different order. The project with Title #1 appears to be focused on <I>Red 
    Haired Musicians</I>. The project with Title #2 appears to be focused on 
    <I>Musical Style Preference</I>. However, both projects are the same! Make 
    sure your words are in the correct order.<BR><BR>
    <UL>Title #1 - <B>Red Haired Musicians and their Preference for Musical 
      Style</B><BR><BR>Title #2 - <B>Music Style Preference of Red Haired 
      Musicians</B></UL><BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try to remove words 
    from your title that really are not necessary for understanding. Title #1 
    has too many words. Title #2 is just as clear but with fewer words.<BR><BR>
    <UL>Title #1 - <B>The Systematic Development of a Local Initiative to 
      Create a Learning Center for Community Education</B><BR><BR>Title #2 - 
      <B>A Local Learning Center for Community Education</B></UL><BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Try and use only a single sentence for your title. If the sentence 
    is getting too long try removing some words. When all else fails try using a 
    two part title with the parts separated by a colon (use only as a last 
    resort!). Do not attempt to use the title as an abstract of your entire 
    proposal.<BR><BR></UL>

  <H2>Project Overview</H2></FONT></B>
  <P></P>
  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Think of the Project Overview as an Executive Summary (the busy 
    executive probably only has enough time to read your Overview - not the 
    entire proposal). Be specific and concise. Do not go into detail on aspects 
    of your proposal that are further clarified at a later point in your 
    proposal.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>The Project Overview 
    should "paint a picture" of your proposal in the mind of the reader. It 
    should establish the framework so that the rest of the proposal has a frame 
    of reference.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Use the Project 
    Overview to begin to show your knowledge of the organization from which you 
    are requesting funds. Key concerns of the funding organization can be 
    briefly identified in relation to your proposed project.<BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>If 
    you will be collaborating with other organizations make sure some of their 
    interests are also highlighted in the Project Overview. This can assist in 
    strengthening the collaboration by recognizing them at the very beginning of 
    your proposal.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>The best time to 
    prepare the Project Overview is after you have completed the entire proposal 
    (and you understand all aspects of your proposal very well). Let the 
    Overview be your last piece of writing and then insert it at the beginning 
    of your proposal.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try to keep in mind 
    that someone will be reviewing your proposal and you would like to have this 
    person be very positive about what you have written. The Project Overview 
    will probably form a strong impression in the mind of the reviewer. Work on 
    your Project Overview so that you can avoid giving this person the 
    opportunity to say things like:<BR>

  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>It may be easier to think of this section as a review of Relevant 
    Literature." Cite previous projects and studies that are similar to what you 
    are proposing. Show the funding agency that you know what you are proposing 
    because you are familiar with what has preceded you.<BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try to be 
    careful in your use of language. It can very helpful to have a friend, 
    outside of your area of focus/expertise, read your proposal to make sure 
    that the language is readable and minimizes the use of:

    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Position your project 
    in relation to other efforts and show how your project:<BR>
    <UL>
      <UL>a) will extend the work that has been previously done, <BR>b) will 
        avoid the mistakes and/or errors that have been previously made, <BR>c) 
        will serve to develop stronger collaboration between existing 
        initiatives, or <BR>d) is unique since it does not follow the same path 
        as previously followed.<BR><BR></UL></UL><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Use the statement of 
    the problem to show that your proposed project is definitely needed and 
    should be funded.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It is essential to 
    include a well documented statement of the need/problem that is the basis 
    for your project. What are the pressing problems that you want to address? 
    How do you know these problems are important? What other sources/programs 
    similarly support these needs as major needs? <BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Check to see 
    that the potential funding agency is committed to the same needs/problems 
    that your proposal addresses. Clearly indicate how the problems that will be 
    addressed in your project will help the potential funding agency in 
    fulfilling their own goals and objectives. As you write, keep the funding 
    agency in your mind as a "cooperating partner" committed to the same 
    concerns that you are.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Is there a special 
    reason why you and/or your organization are uniquely suited to conduct the 
    project? (Geographic location, language expertise, prior involvements in 
    this area, close relationship to the project clientele, etc.) <BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>When you get to the Methods Section of your proposal it will be 
    important to refer back to the needs you've identified in this section (and 
    show how your methods will respond to these needs). <BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It can really 
    help gain funding support for your project if you have already taken some 
    small steps to begin your project. An excellent small step that can occur 
    prior to requesting funding is a need assessment that you conduct (survey, 
    interviews, focus groups, etc.). Write up your need assessment as a short 
    Report, cite the Report in your proposal, and include a copy with the 
    proposal. <BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>This is an excellent 
    section to have the reader begin to understand that an ongoing approach to 
    the problem is essential (assuming that you are proposing a project that is 
    ongoing in nature) and that short term responses may have negligible effect. 
    This can begin to establish a rationale for why your project needs external 
    funding - it seeks to provide a <I>long term response</I>.<BR><BR></UL>

      width=17>Goals are the large statements of what you hope to accomplish but

    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Your objectives will

    basis for the evaluation of your project.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try to insure that 
    there is considerable overlap between the goals and objectives for your 
    proposal and the goals and objectives of the funding organization. If there 
    is not a strong overlap of goals and objectives then it might be best to 
    identify a different funding organization.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Present measurable 
    objectives for your project. If you are dealing with "things" it is easier 
    for them to be measured than if you are dealing with abstract ideas. Your 
    proposal is easier for a prospective funding organization to understand (and 
    the outcomes are much more clear) if you describe your objectives in 
    measurable ways. <BR><BR></UL><B><FONT color=#008000>

    funding agency to see how much the clientele group has been involved with 
    the project and the preparation of the proposal. (Sometimes a project is

  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>There should be a very clear link between the methods you describe

    include the collaborative relationships your project will be developing with

    addresses?<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Your Methods section

  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Collaborative efforts (an important project resource) are usually 
    considered very favorably! Many funding agencies like to see cooperative 
    ventures as the basis for local action. In other words, the funding agency's 
    dollars are being brought together with other existing organizations that 
    are already committed and involved in dealing with the needs that the 
    project is responding to. <BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Sometimes local 
    resources go unnoticed and are difficult to see. Look carefully around you 
    because there are certain to be resources that you have available that you 
    may not be noticing (time that volunteers donate to your project, materials 
    that local merchants may provide, local experts who can provide help/advise 
    when needed, a friend who is willing to do some word processing, etc.). Such 
    in-kind resources can show a potential funding agency that you are strongly 
    rooted in your community.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It is very impressive 
    to a prospective funding agency if local resources have already been

    project. Funding sources are usually much more willing to provide funds for 
    the support of personnel than they are to support the purchase of equipment 
    (that may or may not directly benefit the funded project).<BR><BR><IMG

    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It will help if you've 
    really done some research on the actual cost of the equipment you specify. 
    This is much better than "guessing" at the cost and then to be challenged on 
    your estimates by the potential funding agency.<BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It is easy to 
    overlook many of the office supplies that will be needed for your project. 
    Will you be needing printed letterhead stationery? And, if you will be 
    mailing many letters, have you considered the current cost of postage (and 
    possible increases in cost)? Do you have a good idea how much paper is 
    needed to support the use of a computer word processor? Have you recently 
    checked the price on such things as sticky notes, paper clips, or 
    pencils/pens? A trip to a local office supply store could be most 
    appropriate.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Coffee, cups, donuts or 
    other "supplies" for morning and afternoon breaks are usually not included 
    in the proposal. These are personal (not project) expenses.<BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>How will you be sharing information about your project with others? 
    Will your project include a Newsletter? How about a website? The more open 
    you are and willing to help others learn from your experiences the more 
    likely a funding agency will be interested in assisting.<BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Consider including in your proposal additional funds for hosting 
    some form of workshop or institute where you can bring together other 
    professionals who are interested in conducting a similar type of project in 
    their area. This would be a good way to publicly recognize your funding 
    organization. Invite someone from the funding organization to attend the 
    workshop so they can hear what others think about the investment they have 
    made.<BR><BR></UL><B><FONT color=#008000>

    width=17>Make your budget <B>realistic</B>. Carefully think through exactly 
    what you will need from the funding agency to carry out the project and 
    establish your budget around this amount. (Do not forget, funding agencies 
    receive lots of requests for funding. They can easily tell when someone has 
    inflated a budget in order to procure funds for other purposes. Don't get 
    caught in this situation.)<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17

    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Do you really need a 
    large amount of funding at the beginning of the project or will your project 
    be "phased up" over a period of time? Sometimes it's not very realistic to 
    expect a new project to be able to be up and operating (and spending large 
    amounts of money) during the first 6 months or year of 
    operation.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>A good strategy to use 
    with a potential funding agency is to ask for a small amount of funding for 
    the first phase of the project. Specify in your proposal what you expect to 
    achieve during this "minimal funding phase" and when you will be returning 
    to the funding agency to ask for funds for the next phase. This can suggest 
    to the funding agency that they can terminate the relationship easily if 
    your project is not successful (and then it is essential for you to make 
    sure the first phase IS successful).<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17

    funding agency doesn't have any suggested/required budget categories,

    itemizing your budget are:<BR>

  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>It's important to describe in your proposal exactly how you will 
    decide whether or not your project has been successful, achieved its 
    objectives, etc. The Evaluation Plan will tell the prospective funding 
    agency how you will be going about showing them at the end of the project 
    that their investment in you was a good one.<BR><BR><IMG align=left 
    height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>If you plan 
    to use a survey or questionnaire to help in evaluating the success of your 
    project you may want to include in the <A 
    href="http://www.learnerassociates.net/proposal/hints17.htm">Appendices</A> 
    a draft of what you are considering for the 
    questionnaire/survey.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Your evaluation plan 
    does not have to be elaborate but it is important to indicate to the 
    prospective funding agency that you have not forgotten this important 
    step.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try to include both a 
    concern for <B>formative evaluation/process evaluation</B> (ways to gain 
    feedback on the project while it is being conducted) and <B>summative 
    evaluation/product evaluation</B> (ways to show that the project fulfilled 
    that which was originally proposed). Another way of conceptualizing this is 
    that formative evaluation/process evaluation is concerned with the 
    activities of the project. On the other hand, summative evaluation/product 
    evaluation is concerned with the stated objectives of the 
    project.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>It is easy to create a 
    summative evaluation/product evaluation plan if you have done a good job of 
    clearly stating your project objectives or expected outcomes.<BR><BR><IMG 
    align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Make direct reference to your objectives in your evaluation plan. 
    This creates a strong sense of integration/consistency within your proposal. 
    The reader of your proposal will now be hearing the same message repeated in 
    different sections of your proposal.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>Try creating two 
    separate evaluation plans - one for formative evaluation and the other for 
    summative evaluation.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
    src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17>A good evaluation plan 
    should include some sense of concern for what goes on following the 
    conclusion of the funding period. How will the initiatives that have been 
    started under the project be sustained? Have new things occurred that will 
    be continued in the future? How will other cooperating agencies assist in 
    continuing the project after the conclusion of the funding period? These and 
    other areas should be included in a viable evaluation plan.<BR><BR></UL>

  <P>
  <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
    width=17>Appendices should be devoted to those aspects of your project that 
    are of secondary interest to the reader. Begin by assuming that the reader 
    will only have a short time to read your proposal and it will only be the 
    main body of your proposal (not the Appendices). Then, assume that you have 
    gotten the attention of the reader who would now like some additional 
    information. This is the purpose of the Appendices.<BR><BR>Here are some 
    possible sections to include in the Appendices:<BR><BR>
    <UL><IMG align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
      width=17><B>Dissemination Plan</B> - An important aspect of your proposal 
      will be the plan for disseminating information of/from the project to 
      other audiences. Most funding agencies are interested in seeing how their 
      financial support of your project will extend to other audiences. This may 
      include newsletters, workshops, radio broadcasts, presentations, printed 
      handouts, slide shows, training programs, etc. If you have an advisory 
      group involved with your project they can be very helpful in disseminating 
      project information to other audiences.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
      src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17><B>Time Line</B> - A 
      clear indication of the time frame for the project and the times when each 
      aspect of the project will be implemented. Try creating the time line as a 
      graphic representation (not too many words). If done well, it will help 
      demonstrate the feasibility of the project in a very visible way. 
      <BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
      src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17><B>Letters of 
      Support</B> - Funding agencies would like to know that others feel 
      strongly enough about your project that they are willing to write a letter 
      in support of the project. Talk through with the potential letter writers 
      the sort of focus that you think will be important for their letter. (Try 
      and draw on the reputation of the letter writing group.) Do not get pushed 
      into writing the letters for the agencies - they will all sound alike and 
      will probably defeat your purpose of using them. The letters must be 
      substantive. If not, do not use them! Have the letters addressed directly 
      to the funding agency. (Do not use a general "To Whom It May Concern" 
      letter - it makes it appear that you are applying to many different 
      potential funding agencies and are using the same letter for each. This 
      may really be the case, so make sure you personalize each letter to the 
      specific potential funding agency.)<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=17 
      src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" width=17><B>Cooperating Agency 
      Descriptions</B> - If you have referenced in your proposal different 
      cooperating agencies that you will be working with, it is a good idea to 
      provide a more detailed description of each of these agencies in the 
      Appendices. Rather than include large descriptions of each cooperating 
      agency, a single page that gives the name/address of the agency, names of 
      key personnel, and brief descriptions of the major services provided is 
      sufficient. Try and prepare each of these single page descriptions so they 
      follow a similar outline/presentation of information.<BR><BR><IMG 
      align=left height=17 src="Proposal%20Writing%20Hints_files/star.gif" 
      width=17><B>Evaluation Instrument</B> - Include a draft copy of the actual 
      evaluation instrument you plan to use (survey, questionnaire, interview 
      guide, etc.). This will let your prospective funding agency know that you 
      are serious about making evaluation an integral part of your project - and 
      funding agencies like to hear this! Indicate DRAFT at the top of the 
      instrument and then make it look as real as possible. Never say things 
      like, "I think I may have a question that deals with...", or "Four or five 
      questions will be included that examine the concern of...". If you will be 
      using an interview procedure or a focus group discussion, include a draft 
      copy of the specific questions that will actually be used for the 
      interview/discussion.<BR><BR></UL></UL></UL><BR>
