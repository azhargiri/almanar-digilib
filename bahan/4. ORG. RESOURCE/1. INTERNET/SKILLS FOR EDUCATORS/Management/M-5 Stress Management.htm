      <H2 align=justify>Stress Management M-5</H2><I>
      <P>What cannot be fixed must be endured.</I></P>
      <P>When did you last have one of those stressful days. . .the kind that 
      proves Murphy's law about everything going wrong that possibly could:</P>
      <P>- The alarm didn't go off and you missed your 7:30 meeting.</P>
      <P>- The stove went on the blink as you were fixing breakfast.</P>
      <P>- The secretary of your community club resigned so you answered letters 
      all day.</P>
      <P>- Club members decided they didn't have time to prepare for the Fair 
      booth next week and you are going to lose the $50 deposit that you made 
      from your personal account.</P>
      <P>- You got stuck in a traffic jam on the way home.</P>
      <P>As the pressure mounts, so does your blood pressure and soon your head 
      aches or your stomach hurts. You begin snapping at everyone (including 
      strangers). Your heart pounds and you find yourself either becoming more 
      aggressive or withdrawing into yourself.</P>
      <P>What you are experiencing is a stress attack, and it is one of the most 
      common phenomenon in today's world of work. According to management expert 
      Karl Albrecht, stress-related illness costs industry over 150 billion 
      dollars a year. It has become known as the "quiet killer," as it 
      contributes to most of the major health problems (i.e., heart disease, 
      hypertension, ulcers, cancer).</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>By the time you finish this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Anticipate situations and events that cause stress.<BR>2. Prepare 
      yourself to better deal with stress.</P><B>
      <P align=center>UNDERSTANDING STRESS</B></P>
      <P>As a leader in today's world, you not only need to understand stress, 
      but you must also learn to manage it effectively if you are to survive in 
      a healthy, productive, and successful manner. Your very life may depend on 
      your skill in anticipating and handling stress!</P>
      <P>Let's examine that hectic set of events we listed above. There are 
      three components of stress in each of them.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. <U>The stressor</U> - that event or incident in the environment 
        that arouses stress.</P>
        <P>2. Your <U>perception</U> of that stressor (how it will affect 
        you).</P>
        <P>3. Your <U>reaction</U> or physical and emotional response to the 
        stressor based on that perception.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This information explains why some people view a seemingly stressful 
      incident so much more calmly than others. Let's take the traffic jam for 
      instance. One person impatiently views it as a maddening inconvenience. 
      Another person in the next car may see it as a chance to listen to a 
      favorite tape and unwind before re-entering his or her life with the 
      family. It's the same traffic jam--but both the perceptions and reactions 
      are very different. Therefore, it is stress-inducing to one and 
      stress-reducing to the other.</P>
      <P>What this points out is that in coping with stress, we have three 
      options:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. remove ourselves from the situation or stressor;</P>
        <P>2. re-engineer the situation so it is no longer stressful;</P>
        <P>3. teach ourselves to react differently (change our attitudes) 
        regarding things we find stressful that we cannot change or 
      leave.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Research has shown that it is prolonged, unrelieved stress that is the 
      most debilitating, so those are the situations to work on first. Two 
      frequent responses to stress are either anger or fear and they evoke 
      different reactions:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Anger - fight</P>
        <P>Fear - flight</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Both responses involve the entire body. The stress response pumps the 
      necessary adrenaline and blood throughout our system to help us mobilize 
      for action. When we stay in a stressful situation too long, we end up 
      "stewing in our own juices" and this can have serious consequences to our 
      health and well being.</P>
      <P>Dr. Donald Tubesing, a well-known author and lecturer on stress 
      management, sounds a hopeful note. He states that most people handle 98 
      percent of potentially stressful situations successfully. The other two 
      percent are what cause the problem. He and other experts remind us that 
      not all stress is bad, as it is often what provides the excitement and 
      zest that counteracts boredom and stagnation. The key is to find your 
      appropriate and healthy stress level and to choose which stresses to keep 
      and which to shed. Tubesing also notes that this sorting out process can 
      be aided by asking yourself these three questions:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Does a threat exist?</P>
        <P>2. Is it worth a fight?</P>
        <P>3. If I fight, will it make a difference?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>By answering these questions, it will help you keep from "spending $10 
      worth of adrenaline on a 10 cent problem." The goal is to try to learn to 
      expend the appropriate amount of energy on problems or stressors based on 
      their long term importance to you. If you overreact to small things (like 
      traffic jams and lost socks) you will use up your stress energy 
      inappropriately.</P>
      <P>One of the most seductive temptations for leaders is be all things to 
      all people. This is sometimes referred to as the "Messiah Complex." It is 
      what leads to longer and longer hours, more and more projects, weekend and 
      evening commitments, and eventual burnout. It so often looks easier, 
      quicker, and more effective to do things yourself rather than going 
      through the time and effort to recruit, train, and supervise volunteers to 
      help you. Besides, it's kind of nice to feel you have climbed on that 
      pedestal called "indispensable." Remember--the only way to get off a 
      pedestal is down and it behooves you to climb down before you fall 
off!</P>
      <P>A large part of your job as a leader is to be a manager: <U>someone who 
      works with and through others to accomplish organizational goals</U>. And 
      how those "others" feel about working with you has a tremendous impact on 
      both the quality and quantity of work they will do. . .which has a 
      tremendous impact on your own perceptions of your effectiveness as a 
      manager. . .which has a tremendous impact on your own stress level . . 
      .which has a tremendous impact on your health and peace of mind.</P>
      <P>In the book <U>Survival Skills for Managers</U>, several suggestions 
      are listed to help manage the stress in your life:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Clarify your values. Be sure that most of your time and energy 
        goes towards those things of greatest value to you;</P>
        <P>2. Take good care of yourself physically through exercise and 
        nutrition;</P>
        <P>3. Create and use personal support systems where you can share your 
        successes;</P>
        <P>4. Learn to let go of past resentments, toxic relationships, and bad 
        health habits;</P>
        <P>5. Seek variety and a well-rounded personality--avoid being a 
        one-dimensional workaholic;</P>
        <P>6. Maintain optimism and keep some optimists around you;</P>
        <P>7. Try to make the workplace and work itself more enjoyable;</P>
        <P>8. Don't let small things become a hassle;</P>
        <P>9. Take responsibility for yourself,</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>a. Take action today to change what needs to be 
        changed,</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>b. Develop creativity and flexibility, and</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>c. Have faith that things can be 
      different.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Most effective leaders have been, first of all, effective as persons. 
      They are well-rounded, involved, enthusiastic life-long learners who 
      always see themselves on a "journey of becoming."</P><B>

      <P>EXERCISE: RELAXING</B></P>
      <P>Teaching yourself to react differently to a stressful situation may 
      seem difficult. There are many techniques for relieving your own stress. 
      Try this one:</P>
      <P>Sit on the edge of a straight chair, your knees about 12 inches apart, 
      your legs slanting forward at an angle greater than 90 degrees. (To relax, 
      it is important not to be distracted by tight clothing, and to set aside 
      your watch and glasses.) Sit up very straight. Now let yourself collapse 
      like a rag doll, your head forward, your spine rounded, your hands coming 
      to rest on your knees. Check yourself to be sure you are comfortable and 
      then talk to yourself: "My right arm is heavy, my right arm is heavy..." 
      Repeat this 10 times while concentrating on your arm from the armpit to 
      the fingertips. Then make a fist, flex your arms, take a deep breath and 
      open your eyes. Repeat the procedure three or four times a day. After you 
      become adept at making your right arm heavy, you can extend the heaviness 
      to legs and the whole body until you can relax from head to toe. Use this 
      technique when you feel yourself getting tense.</P>
      <P>Another technique is to sigh deeply, making a sound of deep relief. Let 
      all of the air out of your lungs. Then simply permit the air to come back 
      in. You do not have to force yourself to inhale; it will happen naturally. 
      Do this 10 times.</P>
      <P>When it becomes natural and pleasant to breathe "into your stomach," 
      practice it at odd moments during the day, taking three or four deep 
      breaths and putting all your attention into the relaxation of breathing. 
      When you have learned to get that relaxed feeling from the breathing, you 
      can practice every time you start to feel tense. When your throat tightens 
      as you are driving and you have to stop at a red light, use this time to 
      breathe. When something upsetting happens at the office or at home, stop 
      and breathe. These simple, natural breaths, given some attention, have a 
      potent effect as circuit breakers for tension.</P>
      <P>Try the relaxation techniques at least once each day for a week--when 
      you feel tense.</P>
      <P>Are there other simple relaxation techniques that you have used 
      successfully? Share them with a friend.</P><B>
