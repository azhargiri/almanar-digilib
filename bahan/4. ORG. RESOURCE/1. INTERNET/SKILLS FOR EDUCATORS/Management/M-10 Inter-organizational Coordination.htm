      <H2>Inter-organizational Coordination M-10</H2><FONT face="Times New"><I>
      <P>When life gives you scraps, make a quilt.</I></P>
      <P>We talk a lot about working with other organizations in order to avoid 
      duplication and share resources. Then when we have an opportunity to 
      collaborate we drag our feet. Why? Maybe we tried it once and had a bad 
      experience. We were forced to work with someone who was not trustworthy. 
      They took all of the credit for successes and we got all of the blame for 
      any problems. </P>
      <P>You can find a dozen reasons NOT to collaborate with other 
      organizations. If you are not really sincere about wanting to collaborate, 
      better to admit it and leave this module until you really need to do 
      it.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. List 5 reasons for and against working with another 
      organization.<BR>2. Describe 5 "degrees" of coordination between two 
      organizations.<BR>3. Describe a process for implementing coordinated 
      programs.<BR>4. Make a sincere effort for coordinating an educational 
      program with another organization.</P><B>
      <P>OPTIONAL EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>If you are not really certain about interorganizational coordination 
      maybe you need to clarify your own thoughts. Work with a partner or a 
      learning group to list the potential advantages and disadvantages of 
      working with other organizations to accomplish an educational program. See 
      if you can list 10 reasons on each side of the issue.</P><B>
      <P align=center>DEGREE OF COORDINATION</B></P>
      <P>Agreeing to collaborate with another organization does not necessarily 
      mean "all or nothing." Note the following degrees of coordination.</P>
      <P>1. No Coordination (no activity nor desire to work with the other 
      organization even though they may provide similar programs).</P>
      <P>2. Low Degree of Coordination </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) informal and infrequent contacts between individuals</P>
        <P>b) exchange of general information to keep each other informed</P>
        <P>c) clients are referred to the other organization when it can better 
        respond to the clients' particular needs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>3. Moderate Degree of Coordination</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) formal exchange of information (planned joint meetings, exchange 
        of newsletters, annual report, meeting agendas)</P>
        <P>b) exchange of personal and resources for particular programs</P>
        <P>c) joint projects or programs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>4. High Degree of Coordination</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) written agreements or contracts</P>
        <P>b) joint budgets</P>
        <P>c) same (or overlapping) boards of directors</P>
        <P>d) joint ownership (of building, offices, equipment).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>5. Merger (the two organizations become one).</P>
      <P>This list should give you some ideas about coordination with another 
      organization. This list of degrees of coordination, however, does not tell 
      you how to work together to get to a preferred degree of coordination. 
      That comes from a process which we will examine next.</P><B>
      <P align=center>PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING COORDINATED PROGRAMS</B></P>
      <P>1. Identify the area (i.e., program) to be impacted.</P>
      <P>2. See if the other organization is willing to discuss a coordinated 
      program. </P>
      <P>3. Carefully and thoroughly define the needs of each organization and 
      the potential problems that each organization might encounter.</P>
      <P>4. At this point each of the organizations needs to independently 
      determine that the opportunities are important enough and the potential 
      problems are small enough to proceed in discussions.</P>
      <P>5. For each of the problems, specify optional solutions. Agree on the 
      best solution for both organizations for each problem.</P>
      <P>6. Examine resources and agree on who provides what. </P>
      <P>7. Write goals and objectives.</P>
      <P>8. Incorporate the answers to 5, 6, and 7 into a plan which tells Who 
      does What by When.</P>
      <P>9. Each organization should study the plan and approve it or amend it 
      and continue with the planning until joint agreement is reached.</P>
      <P>10. Joint agreement should be formalized by signing the plan or a 
      memorandum of understanding that states why and how the agencies will 
      coordinate their efforts. This document can be a very simple one- page 
      document or it can be a legal contract which anticipates possible 
      eventualities that are not addressed in the plan.</P>
      <P>11. Both organizations should agree on situations where each may need 
      to abandon the effort to coordination. Worst case scenarios are better 
      discussed in advance (privately) than dealt with in the middle of program 
      implementation (publicly).</P>
      <P>12. Follow the plan (or the agreement).</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. Which organizations have similar programs and interests as 
yours?</P>
      <P>2. Which organization would be easiest (and most beneficial) to 
      coordinate a program with your organization?</P>
      <P>3. Would coordination benefit your program and theirs?</P>
      <P>4. What problems might your organization (and theirs) encounter?</P>
      <P>5. What benefits might be anticipated with a successfully coordinated 
      program?</P>
      <P>6. What would be the worst case scenario? How would you deal with 
      it?</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Work with a partner in your organization to answer the questions above 
      and anticipate the outline of an agreement with another organization for a 
      joint program.</P>
      <P>If the plan looks good, get a general approval from your organization's 
      decision makers to actually try it--to enter discussions with the other 
      organization. Determine who to contact in the other organization and 
      follow the steps of the process outlined above.</FONT>
