      <H2 align=justify>Social Action Process M-1</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>Lip service is one thing, doing it is something 
      else.</I></P>
      <P>Working on community projects is not the same as working for a business 
      or an institution. There are many more unknowns. There are fewer rules 
      that are understood. Two sociologists from Iowa State University, Dr. 
      George Beal and Dr. Joseph Bohlen, studied this problem and developed a 
      model to explain how projects happen in a community. Understanding this 
      model can help leaders to carry out their plans and manage projects more 
      effectively.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After completing this reading you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe the steps in the "social action process" model.<BR>2. 
      Explain how community projects get started.<BR>3. Define "the initiating 
      set, legitimizer, the diffusion set."<BR>4. Compare this model to the 
      program planning process (module E-4).</P><B>
      <P align=center>TWO BEGINNING CONCEPTS</B></P>
      <P>All social action takes place in some sort of SOCIAL SYSTEM...never in 
      a vacuum. Some examples of social systems may be the state, the county, 
      the community, a church, or a club. Social action must be related to one 
      of these social systems. A project may or may not involve all of the broad 
      social system as it moves step by step through the Social Action 
      Process.</P>
      <P>For every social action program, there must exist, within the social 
      system, some past experience which relates to the social action under 
      consideration. This is known as the PRIOR SOCIAL SITUATION. Somewhere in 
      the background there is a similar program, or one related to the idea we 
      want to put across, with a history of success, failure, crisis or 
      conflict. If we are to work intelligently we must look at: 1. the overall 
      social system in which the action will be taking place, and 2. the past 
      experience or present situation relating to the program we want to 
      accomplish by social action.</P><B>
      <P align=center>WHAT--OR WHO--STARTS THE PROCESS?</B></P>
      <P>Two or more people agree that some kind of a problem or situation 
      exists and that something should be done about it. Quite often there may 
      be a feeling on the part of the people within the social system that a 
      problem exists and that it is important enough for them to try to get 
      something done about it. It may even be an "insider" connected with the 
      system...but who represents "outside" interests. This member might be a 
      minister, a superintendent of schools, or the county agricultural 
      agent.</P>
      <P>Very often there is some kind of force totally outside of the social 
      system that tries to get action started on a given problem within the 
      system. Perhaps a pressing problem has stimulated some outside force such 
      as a health specialist or some state or federal agency to become 
      interested in the problems within the system. The problem might be weed or 
      pest control and the outside force may decide that action should be taken. 
      In such cases, the initiative to define the problem and start action would 
      come from outside the system.</P><B>
      <P align=center>THE INITIATING SET</B></P>
      <P>Convergence of interest around the problem is the initial step in the 
      Social Action Process. The people who feel that "something should be done" 
      about a problem are the INITIATING SET. They decide that the problem is 
      important enough to do something about it. They are willing to initiate 
      some action. The people involved in the initiating set are all of those 
      who actually originate action on the idea or program.</P><B>
      <P align=center>THE LEGITIMIZERS</B></P>
      <P>In almost every community, or every social system, there are certain 
      people or groups whose approval or acceptance of proposed projects is 
      necessary to make things "legitimate." They put the stamp of approval upon 
      an idea. The initiating set usually takes the problem to the legitimizers 
      and asks them to pass judgement on it. To bypass this group usually spells 
      failure.</P>
      <P>Legitimizers may be one or two people. Sometimes it is an informal 
      group of three, four, five or six people. Sometimes it may be a formal 
      group such as a church, the chamber of commerce, a service club, or public 
      officials.</P>
      <P>Legitimizers have a reputation for doing things that are good for the 
      community. Thus legitimization is the giving of sanction by key persons or 
      key groups which leads to public acceptance of an idea. The ultimate 
      legitimizers of any idea are the people themselves. Before the idea gets 
      to them, however, the "stamp of approval" is needed from the key people or 
      groups. </P><B>
      <P align=center>THE DIFFUSION SET</B></P>
      <P>After an idea has been "legitimized," it is ready to be moved on to the 
      "diffusion stage." The DIFFUSION SET takes the program to the public. Up 
      to this point the idea has been considered by only a few people who are in 
      the initiating set or who are legitimizers. </P>
      <P>Careful consideration should be given to the selection of those to 
      serve as the diffusion set. They should have the promotion ability of 
      sales people, the appeal of an advertiser, the zeal of a missionary, and 
      the dedication of an educator. The "idea people" (i.e., initiators) may 
      not necessarily be the best people to convince others that a problem 
      exists. The diffusion set should be recognized by the public as action 
      leaders.</P><B>
      <P align=center>DEFINING THE NEED</B></P>
      <P>Once the diffusion set is ready to function, its task is to make the 
      problem become the people's problem. This is done by helping the people 
      DEFINE THE NEED as one of their own. This definition of the need is often 
      a very difficult step in the social action process.</P>
      <P align=left>Several techniques may be used to get large numbers of 
      people to see a problem and identify it as one of their problems, too. 
      They are: 1) basic education, 2) program development committees, 3) survey 
      or questionnaire, 4) comparison and competition, 5) exploiting a crisis, 
      6) trials or demonstrations, 7) building on past experience, and 8) 
      channeling gripes.</P><B>
      <P align=center>COMMITMENT TO ACTION</B></P>
      <P>Quite often, people appear to accept an idea and to recognize a need, 
      but they're not motivated enough to act. It's easy to get them to nod 
      their heads...to say, "This is a problem, we should do something about 
      it." When the time comes to give time, money, or resources to solve the 
      problem, however, that's another matter. We can't assume that just because 
      we have an agreement, we have moved people to a willingness to act. </P>
      <P>We must also get from them a commitment to take action. Such 
      commitments to action can be obtained in terms of 1) votes of confidence, 
      2) agreements to attend meetings, 3) agreements to act at the proper time, 
      4) agreements to pledge so much money, and 5) agreements to participate in 
      the program. A commitment to action is one of the most important steps in 
      the social action process.</P><B>
      <P align=center>GOALS</B></P>
      <P>Once there is a felt need established, we must establish some concrete 
      targets, GOALS or objectives. These are the goals which the group is 
      willing to try to reach to solve the problem. Whatever we are going to try 
      to accomplish must be spelled out as to: 1) our destination (this may be 
      likened to the goal line in a football game), 2) the content area (this 
      can be compared to the plays we need to defeat the other team to bring 
      home a victory) and 3) human behavior changes that we hope to bring about 
      (this can be represented by the school spirit generated by having a 
      winning team).</P><B>
      <P align=center>MEANS</B></P>
      <P>Once we have decided what objectives we want to accomplish, we must 
      then decide HOW we are going to do it. Usually we have more trouble 
      agreeing on HOW we are going to do something than on WHAT we are trying to 
      do. This then is the "huddle" stage where the quarterback decides what 
      play will gain the most yardage for the team. We should analyze the play 
      (plan) in terms of consequences and have an alternate plan in mind if we 
      are stopped for "no gain" on the first plan suggested.</P><B>
      <P align=center>PLAN FOR ACTION</B></P>
      <P>After we have set up our goals and have decided on the basic methods we 
      should use, we will then want to set up a PLAN OF WORK -- an action guide 
      with the organizational structure to carry it out. Too often this seems to 
      be the starting point. We do not fully consider the other steps which lead 
      up to the plan. We must design a plan which will carry out our goals and 
      use the methods we have in mind. In the plan of work we should consider 1) 
      time schedule, 2) committees needed, 3) kinds of personnel needed, 4) 
      buildings and facilities required, 5) content materials, 6) visual aids or 
      other methods needed, 7) the need for meetings, 8) communications 
      (personal, group and mass media), 9) publicity requirements and 10) all 
      other planning details.</P><B>
      <P align=center>MOBILIZING AND ORGANIZING RESOURCES</B></P>
      <P>Once we have written our plan of work, then we must MOBILIZE and 
      ORGANIZE the RESOURCES so that the plan can be carried out. The people 
      involved have to begin to take responsibility for their program in terms 
      of time, expense, skill, work, etc.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM</B></P>
      <P>As we move into action most programs will need some sort of a 
      "launching" process which might take the form of a fund drive, a series of 
      tours, a well publicized kick-off dinner, a full page advertisement 
      campaign in the local newspaper, a telephone call network, or a 
      multi-media publicity splurge. In other words, this "launching" is made 
      into a big event so the people will know we are now in the action stages 
      of the program.</P>
      <P>Some programs do not lend themselves to a "sky-rocket" type launching. 
      We must move into them slowly and ease them along carefully but without 
      allowing them to lose momentum.</P><B>
      <P align=center>CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM</B></P>
      <P>Whether or not there is a big launching for the program, once it is 
      started we must follow through with our plan of work. So we go through the 
      various action steps (described in our written plan) as we carry out the 
      program. We take as many action steps as necessary to move us to the 
      completion of our specific objectives and, therefore, of our overall 
      goals.</P><B>
      <P align=center>FINAL EVALUATION</B></P>
      <P>Between each of the action steps, as at all other places along the 
      Social Action Process, we stop and evaluate. We must evaluate what we have 
      done, our next immediate step, how well we are meeting our immediate 
      objective, and alternative methods for reaching that objective. In other 
      words we decide as to what our next move is going to be. Then we plan our 
      next move. Finally we act in relation to that plan.</P>
      <P>Eventually we get to the point where we have a final evaluation to "sum 
      up" the project. We need to know: 
      <DL>
        <DD>--did we accomplish what we set out to do? 
        <DD>--were the methods we used the best? 
        <DD>--did we make effective use of available resources? 
        <DD>--what parts of our project were successful? why? 
        <DD>--what parts of our project were unsuccessful? why? 
        <DD>--what would we do differently if we could do the project over? 
        <DD>--what did we learn that could be used for other projects? 
        <DD>--where do we go from here? </DD></DL>
      <P>Evaluation can be defined as a process to determine if objectives have 
      been met? Depending on your specific objectives, the evaluation 
      instruments you use will differ from one project to another. Module E-10 
      has examples of some evaluation instruments and a more complete discussion 
      of the evaluation process.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTION FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>Does the social action process fit with the program planning process 
      explained in Module E-4? How are they alike? How are they 
different?</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISES:</B></P>
      <P>1. Analyze your organization or a group or institution with which you 
      are familiar. Which individuals usually are the initiating set? Which ones 
      are the legitimizers? Which individuals would you expect to do the 
      diffusion? Who would usually carry out the project. </P>
      <P>If the answers to these questions depend on the specific type of 
      project, then pick a project (current or future) and use that project as 
      the frame of reference for answering the questions above.</P>
      <P>2. Pick a project which you would like to introduce in your community. 
      Use the social action process to help you "think through" how you would 
      plan, implement and evaluate that project. This exercise could take you 
      several hours if you really get involved in the details. You may want to 
      work in pairs or show your preliminary ideas to a friend who can comment 
      on the accuracy and completeness of your plan.</FONT>
