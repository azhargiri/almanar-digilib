      <H2 align=justify>Implementing a Plan M-2</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>Perseverance is what gets us to our goals.</I></P>
      <P align=justify>After you plan your work (modules E-4 through E-9), then 
      you should "work your plan." Implementing the plan requires considerable 
      skill and attention. </P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P align=justify>After mastering this section, you should be able to:</P>
      <P align=justify>1. Identify skills needed to implement plans.<BR>2. 
      Distinguish between "immediate" concerns and "important" concerns.<BR>3. 
      Choose actions which will help you to be a better manager.<BR>4. Carry out 
      your plan of work.</P><B>
      <P align=center>CARRYING OUT YOUR PLAN</B></P>
      <P>When moving from ideas to action, several steps are involved. First, 
      you must have ideas. Then you must choose the most important ideas 
      (priorities) to work on. Next you must write those ideas as goals and 
      objectives. Then you must make sure you have the resources to carry out 
      those objectives. And you must write down a plan which tells how the 
      objectives will be met. The plan tells <U>who</U> does <U>what </U>by 
      <U>when</U> (deadline). Modules E-4 through E-9 discusses these steps<B> 
      </B>in detail. Now you are ready to carry out the plan. Here you put your 
      ideas into action. At this point leadership is critical.</P>
      <P>In the broadest sense you need to apply everything you know about 
      leadership in order to get action on your plan. You need to understand 
      yourself and how to best lead given the current situation (modules L-1 and 
      L-5). You must use teamwork (L-2) and stay within your organization's 
      mission and limitations (E-13 and E-14). You must get people to do the 
      various tasks and keep them moving forward (V-2, V-3, V-4, V-5, V-6). You 
      must communicate effectively with others and help people working on the 
      plan to communicate effectively with each other (C-1, C-2, C-3). You must 
      expect conflict to arise and then deal with it constructively (M-3). You 
      must stay on track with your plan, but adjust it as necessary. You must 
      use meetings carefully to make decisions and keep everyone together (L-3 
      and L-4). Finally you must do all of the above at the same time. You must 
      use your leadership resources where they are most needed to keep 
      everything else going.</P>
      <P>There are, however, some specific skills that will help in carrying out 
      activities described in the plan. These skills need attention. They 
      include supervision, time management, coaching and self discipline. 
      Supervision is discussed in the next section as a separate subject.</P><U>
      <P>Time </U>management is mostly a matter of working smarter--not so much 
      harder. The self-management exercise in module M-4 is a time management 
      technique. To strengthen your time management skills complete module 
      M-4.</P><U>
      <P>Coaching</U> is familiar to most of us. That doesn't mean, however, we 
      are all natural coaches. Good coaching begins with explaining and 
      demonstrating the fundamentals. A good soccer coach doesn't just tell a 
      beginning player to "kick the ball hard." The coach demonstrates how to 
      back up several steps, to approach the ball at a 45 degree angle to the 
      direction of the kick, to plant the non-kicking foot beside the ball, to 
      bend the knee of the backswing, to lock the knee and ankle just before 
      contact, to keep the shoulders over the ball with head down and eye on the 
      ball until it is kicked, and to follow through with the kicking foot in 
      the intended direction of the ball.</P>
      <P>The coach breaks down a complex task into easy parts, demonstrates each 
      part, then puts the parts together. Next, the coach watches the athlete in 
      action (a drill or a game), observes errors, and goes back over that part 
      until the athlete understands and performs correctly.</P>
      <P>You can use this same approach in supervising volunteers. You observe 
      the volunteer in action, suggest an improved way to do the job, and check 
      to see if the suggestion was understood (and carried out if accepted by 
      the volunteer). It is through coaching that a supervisor trains and 
      develops people. A coach needs to spend plenty of time at it, especially 
      when the volunteer is inexperienced.</P><U>
      <P>Self-discipline</U> means staying calm, composed and confident whatever 
      happens. Easy to say, but often hard to do! It's like the cartoon of the 
      guy in the middle of the swamp who says, "When you're waist deep in 
      alligators, it's hard to remember that your original purpose was to drain 
      the swamp."</P>
      <P>Under pressure we all have trouble keeping track of what's important 
      (draining the swamp) while handling the immediate problem (fighting off 
      the alligators). If we do not deal with some immediate problems, we may 
      not make it to the important one. On the other hand, if we spend all of 
      our time on immediate problems, we never make it to the important ones 
      either.</P>
      <P>Following is a checklist to help you evaluate your needs and do a 
      better job of carrying out the plan. It is divided into two parts: 1. 
      fighting alligators (dealing with immediate problems of program 
      management) and 2. draining the swamp (dealing with long-range problems of 
      program management). Don't try to do everything on the list at once. Work 
      on one or two key things at a time.</P><U>
      <P>Fighting Alligators</U></P>
      <P>1. Keep a listing of things you want to do. Do this on a pad or in a 
      notebook. Cross off things as they are finished. One refinement is to make 
      a weekly list, then transfer any unfinished items to next week's list.</P>
      <P>2. Learn to listen--by practicing listening skills.</P>
      <P>3. Ask <U>why? </U>--about everything.</P>
      <P>4. Develop, maintain, use, and later on, evaluate a schedule or 
      timetable for the things you want to do. The next year should be quite 
      general; the next week should be quite specific.</P>
      <P>5. Keep an eye out for things--little or big--that your people 
      (volunteers and staff) do that deserve recognition, either by you, your 
      boss, or the organization head--then see</P>
      <P>that they get it. Mighty easy to overlook this.</P>
      <P>6. Never <U>ignore</U> your people. Praise them certainly--or criticize 
      them out if you absolutely must--but <U>never</U> ignore them.</P>
      <P>7. Use the services of your staff. Help them to work effectively, keep 
      up to date on their subject-matter and on the organization.</P>
      <P>8. Delegate everything you can that your people can handle and that 
      isn't a major decision matter. You can't be everywhere at once or do 
      everything that has to be done. Be as sure as you can of the abilities of 
      each <B>o</B>f your people in this regard. Tell 'em - "Do the best you 
      can. I'm counting on you."</P>
      <P>9. Get people to your meetings (such as regular staff conferences) by 
      having the <U>last person in</U> write up the minutes of the meeting, get 
      them typed, and distributed to all members. Once this policy is set up, 
      nearly everyone gets there early.</P>
      <P>10. Watch--and guard against--the intrusion of the assembly-line 
      philosophy in the work your people do. Variety is important. The business 
      of doing something from start to finish--the <U>whole</U> job--is 
      important. Too much fragmentation of jobs may lead to boredom and 
      quits.</P>
      <P>11. Get to know <U>all</U> the jobs of <U>all</U> the people you 
      supervise. Get them to show you, they'll love it, and you'll know better 
      what your people are up against.</P>
      <P>12. Watch your staff meetings. They can be deadly dull, or fascinating. 
      You need (1) news, (2) training and development, and (3) management 
      improvement at just about every such meeting. Don't short necessary 
      business, of course. <U>Have</U> a program developed ahead of time.</P>
      <P>13. Make use of the resources in your community. Local bankers, food 
      store managers, State and municipal, as well as federal officials all have 
      things to say about management and how <U>they</U> practice it. They're 
      almost always glad to cooperate, by speaking at one of your staff 
      meetings, for example.</P>
      <P>14. Treat auditors and inspectors royally. Be sure they understand your 
      organization--its structure, functions, philosophy, unsolved problems 
      you're tackling, etc. Show your pride in the organization. Most auditors 
      and inspectors aren't used to such treatment. They'll respond by doing a 
      much better job for you.</P>
      <P>15. When a crisis subsides then concentrate on details. Don't just 
      relax and wait for the next crisis. Anticipate it and prevent it by 
      handling the details in advance. Be thorough and persistent.</P>
      <P>16. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it and move on.</P><U>
      <P>Draining the Swamp</U></P>
      <P>1. Develop and maintain a 3-ring binder to contain notes, clippings, 
      quotations, excerpts, etc., important to <U>you</U> in your job of 
      supervision or management. Classify the material in some appropriate 
      manner. This becomes <U>your </U>handbook of management. Review the 
      material from time to time. Take things out that are no longer of 
      interest.</P>
      <P>2. Develop a list of <U>planned reading</U>, containing books and 
      magazines you'd like to read, and perhaps study. Get the cooperation of a 
      librarian--they'll love to help you if they understand that you really do 
      want to read.</P>
      <P>3. Learn to write--by writing. Get help from an editor, and pay 
      attention to his or her suggestions (above all, don't get mad at an editor 
      who's trying to help you).</P>
      <P>4. Update your knowledge all the time by every means you can. Don't let 
      yourself get out of date. Remember, times are changing rapidly.</P>
      <P>5. Send copies of interesting, useful clippings, brochures, quotes that 
      you find, to your supervisor, and to members of your staff with 
      appropriate notes. Also, send a book now and then, marked, as "See 
      especially Chapter 12" or whatever. Ask for a brief book review 
      occasionally at a staff meeting. Make one yourself to get things 
      started.</P>
      <P>6. Be sure you have, <U>in writing</U>, the goals or objectives of your 
      organization, and that all your people know what they are. If you are in 
      charge of one segment or part of your organization, what's your objective 
      in relation to the larger one of your agency or company? Get your people 
      to help you develop this. (see also item 11 below)</P>
      <P>7. Keep everlastingly at the job of developing people on your staff. 
      Help them help themselves, of course. You can take pride in seeing your 
      people leave you for better jobs than you can offer.</P>
      <P>8. When you're recruiting, look for the underemployed. You may be 
      surprised how many people--waiters, post office employees, cabdrivers, 
      waitresses, secretaries--have college degrees or important skills. </P>
      <P>9. Keep an eye on your organization structure, in relation to your 
      objectives. Will it do the job next year? Five years from now? Span of 
      control too large? Too small? What effects will forthcoming changes make? 
      </P>
      <P>10. Make files for use next year (if the program is repeated). Put 
      notes, clippings, addresses, ideas, etc. in a manila file folder to help 
      you next time or to help your successor.</P>
      <P>11. What's in the files that people won't miss if it's removed? Are 
      there any unusual bottlenecks in your procedures? Does it take too long to 
      get some things done? Are some people in your unit overloaded while others 
      are idle? These things can be changed by adjusting assignments and 
      resetting priorities. Involve people, however, in making any 
      changes.</P><U>
      <P>Delegation</U></P>
      <P>Problems with delegation usually result from leaders with delegation 
      blockages.</P>
      <P>1. <U>Untra</U>i<U>ned leaders</U>. Delegation does not occur to them. 
      They can't see the value.</P>
      <P>2. <U>"I" leaders</U>. They want to satisfy personal needs that may be 
      unhealthy or destructive to others. They want to deny feelings of 
      weakness, prove adequacy, enhance self-esteem. To expose the problems of 
      their business may be viewed as evidence of a personal defect, so ideas<B> 
      </B>presented by others, regardless of their value will be rejected.</P>
      <P>3. <U>Competitive leaders</U>. Motivation to compete may be based on 
      such things as desire for promotion, for power, for wealth, control of 
      people, etc. These individuals want to present themselves to others in 
      best possible light--even at others expense.</P>
      <P>4. <U>Fearful leaders</U>. They are insecure regarding their competency 
      and adequacy. It is not so much that they must be right and the other 
      person wrong, they simply can't tolerate mistakes. They check and 
      double-check the work. They strive for perfection.</P>
      <P>5. <U>Incommunicative leaders</U>. They don't deliberately refuse to 
      communicate; rather, they don't know <U>how</U>. Interpersonal 
      difficulties develop because people do not like to be in the dark. (May 
      tell one person, but not others. Directions are often oral, and are 
      garbled.)</P><B>
