      <H2 align=justify>Marketing Programs M-7</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>Laziness is one path to poverty.</I></P>
      <P>Many organizations periodically engage in "marketing campaigns" to 
      publicize meetings, expand membership, seek community support, raise 
      funds, elect someone to a political office, or otherwise promote their 
      cause.</P>
      <P align=center><B>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After completing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe principles of marketing.<BR>2. Plan a marketing strategy 
      for your group or organization.</P>
      <P align=center><B>PRINCIPLES OF MARKETING</B></P>
      <P>The principles of marketing, usually associated with the operation of a 
      business enterprise, are equally pertinent to the promotion and support of 
      non-profit community organizations. Marketing is about creating and 
      retaining customers (supporters) for your organization. Adherence to the 
      following steps will increase the effectiveness of your promotional 
      efforts.</P><U>
      <P>Clarify your objectives</U>. What specifically do you hope to 
      accomplish through your marketing campaign? Are your objectives realistic? 
      Many groups are unsuccessful in their promotional efforts because their 
      objectives are vague (e.g., "educate the public").</P><U>
      <P>Define your product</U>. What are your organization's goals? What goods 
      and services are you "selling"? What is your present image? Are you viewed 
      as a credible organization? Do you need to update your product or change 
      your image for greater appeal?</P>
      <P>Modules E-6 and E-7 in this series discussed priority setting and 
      writing objectives . Your objectives determine your product. The more 
      specific and appealing your goals are, the easier it will be to market 
      them. Organizations like businesses are effective when they offer 
      something people want.</P>
      <P>Assess your competition. What other groups are offering similar 
      services or resources? How well do you stack up to that competition? What 
      is unique about the goods and services you offer? You may wish to modify 
      your product or combine forces with your competition.</P><U>
      <P>Target your audience</U>. Develop a list of "prospects" (specific 
      groups and individuals that you would like to reach with your message). 
      Concentrate your efforts. Good salespeople do not waste time making calls 
      on people who are not in the market for what they have to sell. Collect 
      information on this target audience. Become familiar with their concerns, 
      needs and interests. Target your appeal to those needs. </P><U>
      <P>Develop a marketing strategy</U>. using one or more of the following 
      forms of promotion, to reach your targeted audience: 
      <UL>
        <LI>*Personal selling--oral presentation to an individual or group. 
        <LI>*Direct mail---a printed message directed to a specific individual 
        or group. 
        <LI>*Publicity--the planting of newsworthy information with news media. 
        <LI>*Printed materials--handouts, brochure, fact sheet, fliers, general 
        mailer. 
        <LI>*Advertising--any paid for, non-personal presentation of 
        information. </LI></UL>
      <P>These promotional techniques are listed in order of declining cost 
      effectiveness. That is, the approaches at the top of the list tend to get 
      more results per dollar spent than those at the bottom of the list. Which 
      technique(s) would be most effective in reaching each of the individuals 
      or groups you have targeted?</P><U>
      <P>Make contact</U>. Decide <U>who</U> will do <U>what</U> by <U>when</U>. 
      Review the individuals and groups on your prospect list, and assess who in 
      your group has the strongest contacts with each. The more personal the 
      approach, the more potent. Most people get involved in (or support) a 
      group or a cause because a friend, relative, business associate or 
      neighbor asked them to.</P>
      <P>In using the mass media for public relations, concentrate your efforts 
      on meaty, timely feature articles (in contrast to meeting announcements 
      and reports). Suggest eye-catching headings: "Women's Club To Donate 
      Kidney Machine" instead of "Women's Club Holds Meeting." Such publicity 
      can help people become familiar with who you are. Focus on the good works 
      of the organization rather than on your need for support.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, good marketing involves clear objectives, defining your 
      product, targeting your audience, developing a marketing strategy, and 
      then making personal contact. Notice how these marketing principles were 
      incorporated into the process of recruitment (module V-3. The marketing 
      process will now be applied specifically to fund raising.</P><B>
      <P align=center>FUND RAISING</B></P>
      <P>Any organization or program needs money to operate. Fund raising 
      involves "getting people to serve" through their financial contributions 
      as well as time. A group will be more effective in its fund raising 
      efforts if the preceding principles of marketing are adhered to. The 
      experience of fund raising professionals [2] show the following marketing 
      principles to be particularly important.</P><U>
      <P>Have a good product</U>. What are the services (direct and indirect) 
      you intend to offer people in return for their contribution? Are your 
      group goals clear, specific, and action-oriented?</P>
      <P>Clarify what your group will do with the money raised. It is easier to 
      raise money for specific projects than for the general support of an 
      organization.</P>
      <P>People donate money in direct relation to how strongly they believe in 
      the program or group. Your success in fund raising indicates the 
      popularity of your program. If contributions are not coming in, it may 
      indicate the need to revise your program, to update your product, to 
      change your image to be more responsive and appealing to the concerns and 
      interests of prospective contributors. Publicize the good works of your 
      organization. Sell your program rather than the need for money. People 
      don't buy Buicks because GM needs money.</P><U>
      <P>Map out your strategy</U>. It is what you do in advance that counts the 
      most. Develop a "prospect list" of individuals and organizations with an 
      interest in your product. Your market is everyone who will benefit 
      directly or indirectly from your organization or cause. A source of 
      prospects for a Boy Scout fund raising effort, for example, might be the 
      members themselves, their parents, volunteer supporters, alumni, outdoor 
      and environmental groups, city parks and recreation agencies and people 
      with concern for youth.</P><U>
      <P>Evaluate each prospect's gift potential</U>. Professional fund raisers 
      recommend asking for a specific "target" amount. One of the most common 
      mistakes amateur fund raisers make is asking for too little. Assess what 
      you feel would be the maximum amount each of your individual prospects 
      would be willing to give. Write that amount beside each name.</P><U>
      <P>Solicit</U>. Decide who in the group has the best inroads with each of 
      individuals and groups on your prospect list. Divide the list accordingly. 
      If necessary, do some "intelligence work"--become familiar with each 
      prospect's special interests and concerns.</P>
      <P>Understand that you must work with the world as it really is, rather 
      than as it should be. People come prepackaged with different ideas, 
      emotions, and values. To make your fund raising plan succeed, you have to 
      do your homework and take the time to think about what makes the targeted 
      donor tick. Each person give for a different reason. Tailor your appeal to 
      the specific concerns, needs and interests of the individual.</P>
      <P>A recent study [3] found "the most effective fund raising techniques 
      were those in which one person asked another for a contribution. When a 
      donor is being asked to contribute by a friend, the fund raising approach 
      is more likely to succeed. Telephone calls, telethons, advertisements, and 
      mailers were found to be much less likely to produce contributions." In 
      short, people give to people.</P><U>
      <P>Give value for value</U>. Clearly indicate what donors will receive in 
      return for their contribution. This might include: 
      <UL>
        <LI>A statement of exactly what their contribution will buy, (e.g. $75 
        will send two kids to camp; $150 will get your business' name on the 
        billboard at the entrance to town). 
        <LI>A statement of how the donor will directly or indirectly benefit as 
        a result of your group or program, (e.g., we will lobby on behalf of you 
        and other ranchers to...."). 
        <LI>Personal recognition. 
        <LI>Good public relations for the donor. 
        <LI>A tax deduction. 
        <LI>Feeling good about themselves and what their contribution makes 
        possible. 
        <LI>A sense of immortality. </LI></UL><U>
      <P>Give your personal testament</U> as to the benefits of the group or 
      program. Be upbeat and positive. The advantage (or disadvantage) of 
      face-to-face communication is that your personal commitment and enthusiasm 
      (or lack of it) are going to show through. Be specific rather than 
      speaking in generalities (e.g., "I would not be able to speak to you 
      except for the public speaking skills and confidence I've gained through 
      Scouts. Your support will provide other young people with the same 
      opportunity.") Look the prospective donor in the eye, and ask for the 
      targeted amount. </P><U>
      <P>Practice</U>. Never ask for a donation without having practiced first. 
      Our natural fear and discomfort in asking people for money is overcome 
      through good preparation and practice.</P><U>
      <P>Follow-Up</U>. Acknowledge the gift with a personalized letter. Report 
      on results. Be accountable. Interview benefactors and publicize how the 
      program has benefited them. Build a donor relationship in anticipation of 
      next year's fund raiser.</P><U>
      <P>Celebrate</U>. Get together after the fund drive. Frankly discuss the 
      work, share funny stories, applaud your success, and strategize on the 
      hard cases. Fund raising is more imposing for new members, so give them an 
      extra boost. Reward yourselves for a job well done.</P><U>
      <P>Be Prepared for Disappointments</U>. Sometimes things go wrong. How do 
      you rebound from a fund loser, and save morale? Get together as a group as 
      soon as possible to talk about what went wrong and what can be done 
      immediately to recoup your losses. If there were any mistakes of judgment, 
      the chairperson should quickly accept responsibility. Simply say, "It was 
      my fault." The purpose of your meeting is not to pin the blame. Make a 
      list on paper of what went wrong and what to do differently next time. It 
      is a great psychological relief to pin down the precise problem so it 
      doesn't seem like everything went wrong. Stop dwelling on the "failure," 
      and instead focus on what you will do to make up the loss.</P>
      <P>Finally, we might look briefly at why people don't give. Studies [2] 
      show the primary reasons to be: 
      <UL>
        <LI>They were not asked. 
        <LI>The fund raiser was not in tune with the concerns and interests of 
        the prospective donor. 
        <LI>The fund raiser was not able to tell the story, demonstrate benefit 
        and justify the program. The fund raiser had not anticipated likely 
        questions and was not prepared to answer them. 
        <LI>Potential donors were not asked to give a specific amount, or were 
        not told what that amount would buy.</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 

        <LI>Lack of follow up--a letter of appreciation and reports on 
        accomplishments. </LI></UL>
      <P>In 1986, $74 billion was given in philanthropy. Private individuals 
      gave 85% of that. "Most Americans think giving to charity is an important 
      responsibility. Many say they would increase the amount they give if they 
      were just asked to do so." [3]</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Review the five forms of promotion (above), and decide which 
      approach(es) would be most effective (and most cost efficient) in reaching 
      each of your prospective donors. Work in pairs. Clarify the role each will 
      play.</P>
      <P align=center><B>MONEY RAISING IDEAS</B></P>
      <P>A very effective technique in identifying exciting, innovative fund 
      raising activities--that beat out the competition--is 
      <U>brainstorming</U>. Set aside 20-30 minutes at your next meeting for a 
      brainstorming session. Ask group members to really stretch their 
      imaginations. Mundane as well as far out ideas are encouraged. In 
      conducting the brainstorming session, emphasize that your objective is to 
      come up with as many ideas as possible. Two ground rules are: 1) all ideas 
      are good ideas, and 2) no discussion. Comments such as "The Rotary Club 
      tried that and it didn't work" or "But we've always done it this way" are 
      not allowed. Record all ideas on newsprint or a blackboard for all to see. 
      Encourage participants to build on the ideas of others. Once participants 
      have run out of ideas, take a break. Then come back and evaluate the ideas 
      and select the one or two that seem "right" for the group. Or the ideas 
      can be categorized, typed up and distributed to all members for their 
      consideration at your next meeting. Brainstorming not only generates good 
      ideas, it is also fun and motivational.</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISES</B><U></P>
      <P>Exercise 1:</U></P>
      <P>Think back to times when you were asked to do something, to take on a 
      particular responsibility. Did you find that certain people were more 
      skilled at getting your positive response than others? Why? What worked 
      best in getting your help? What approaches turned you off? Make a list of 
      "do's" and "don'ts" from your own experience. If you are completing this 
      exercise with a study group, share your responses with one another.</P><U>
      <P>Exercise 2:</U></P>
      <P>Focus on a particular group or organization in which you are active. 
      Develop a list of recommendations toward improving the manner in which 
      that organization goes about recruiting people to serve. You might focus 
      on one or more of the following tasks: develop a strategy to expand 
      membership; get better turnout at meetings; elect officers; form a needed 
      committee; or recruit community help.</P>
      <P>If you are completing this program as part of a study group, divide 
      into small groups of 3-5 people. If more than one organization or club is 
      represented, group each separately. Ask each small group to develop 
      recommendations toward improving the manner in which that organization 
      goes about recruiting people to serve. Each group could be assigned a 
      different task, (e.g., develop a strategy to expand membership, get better 
      attendance at meetings, elect a slate of officers, form a needed committee 
      or recruit community help.) Conclude the exercise by having each small 
      group share its recommendation with the larger study group.</P><U>
      <P>Exercise 3:</U></P>
      <P>Outline a marketing strategy for your group or program. Select a 
      specific objective on which to focus (e.g., fund raising, a membership 
      drive, get turnout to an important meeting, develop political support, 
      increase public awareness of your program or cause, or conduct a benefit 
      drive for some charity). Use the following worksheet. (If you are 
      undertaking this exercise within a study group, break into small groups of 
      3 to 5 to complete the exercise.)</P>
