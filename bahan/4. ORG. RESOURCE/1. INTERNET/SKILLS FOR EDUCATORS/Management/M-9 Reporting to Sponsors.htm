      <H2>Reporting to Sponsors M-9</H2><I>
      <P>The one who lies (exaggerates) will not be believed.</I></P>
      <P>If you are perplexed about how to report one of your sponsors, 
      something is wrong. You probably skipped an essential step in program 
      planning or program management. Read on, however, and you should be able 
      to clarify your concern as well as determine how to prepare a specific 
      report for a particular sponsor.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>When you finish this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Discuss how "marketing programs" and "program planning" are closely 
      related to reporting to sponsors.<BR>2. Outline an oral or written report 
      for a specific sponsor.</P><B>
      <P align=center>HAVE A MARKETING STRATEGY</B></P>
      <P>This module is closely related to module M-7 which tells you how to 
      develop a marketing strategy. If you have a well developed marketing 
      strategy you will know your own organization, what it has to offer, and 
      what the sponsor expects from you. Your end-of-program report or progress 
      report will come directly from your marketing strategy. You may wish to 
      refer back to module M-7 now or after you have read through this 
      module.</P>
      <P>In your marketing strategy (if you have one) you identified what your 
      sponsor wanted. That sponsor gave you some kind of support based on the 
      expectation of some specific return (even if that return was something 
      intangible like "a positive public image"). Focus your report on the 
      overlap between what you offered the sponsor and what the sponsor expected 
      as a result of the support given to your organization.</P><B>
      <P align=center>HAVE A PLAN</B></P>
      <P>Even without a great marketing strategy, if you have a well-written 
      plan which your sponsor has agreed to support, you may still be able to 
      prepare an effective report for that sponsor. Look at the objectives for 
      your plan. Look also at the goals of your sponsor. By comparing these two 
      lists you should be able to identify overlap. Focus your report on this 
      common ground.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. What has been our relationship with this sponsor (how long, based on 
      what common interests, current expectations)?</P>
      <P>2. Do we have any formal agreement?</P>
      <P>3. Why did this sponsor agree to support us?</P>
      <P>4. What have we accomplished that would interest the sponsor?</P>
      <P>5. What have we done for the sponsor?</P>
      <P>6. Why should the sponsor continue supporting our organization?</P>
      <P>7. Does this sponsor have a preferred format for reports?</P>
      <P>8. Can we get copies of previous reports that may help us with the 
      format or content of this report?</P><B>
      <P align=center>OUTLINE THE REPORT</B></P>
      <P>If the sponsor has a specific form or format for the report, review it 
      and follow it carefully. If not, use the following outline:</P>
      <P>1. <U>Purpose of the report</U> (i.e., "this is a final report since 
      the program ended last month"; or "this is a progress report because some 
      new opportunities have arisen and we would like your input on some 
      proposed changes in our program").</P>
      <P>2. <U>Background</U> (i.e., "we have been working together for the past 
      five years and you have supported two other major programs of our 
      organization which include . . . ."; or "according to the proposal which 
      you funded we agreed to . . . ."; or "the objectives of our program which 
      you have been supporting are . . . .").</P>
      <P>3. <U>Summary of Accomplishments</U> (brief overview of 
highlights).</P>
      <P>4. <U>Inputs</U> (what your organization contributed to the program in 
      terms of time, money, materials, services, expertise).</P>
      <P>5. <U>Review of Activities</U></P>
      <P>6. <U>Results</U> (reported according to the objectives with at least 
      one paragraph for each objective). 
      <DL>
        <DD>Who participated? 
        <DD>What were participants' reactions to the program? 
        <DD>How did the participants change their knowledge, skills, attitudes 
        or aspirations? 
        <DD>What did participants do as a result of the program? 
        <DD>What long term impact did the program have on the participants or on 
        the community? 
        <DD>How did the sponsor benefit from this program? </DD></DL>
      <P>7. <U>Lessons Learned</U></P>
      <P>8. <U>Future Plans</U></P>
      <P>9. <U>Summary and Conclusions</U> (review highlights and tell how 
      sponsors support was essential to the program activities or 
      results).</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Prepare an outline of a report for a particular sponsor. This exercise 
      will be much more effective if it is applied to a real situation rather 
      then a hypothetical situation. Decide if the report will be written or 
      oral. If oral, prepare appropriate audio-visual aids to illustrate and 
      strengthen the impact of the report.</FONT> <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
