      <H2 align=justify>Using Advisory Groups M-6</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>The person who can't take advice doesn't reach old 
      age</I></P>
      <P>Many organizations could benefit from a strong, active advisory 
      committee. Many groups which have advisory committees could benefit more 
      if the advisory committee were better organized, better informed, or 
      better motivated.</P>
      <P align=center><B>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>This module will help you to:</P>
      <P>1. Form (or reorganize) an advisory committee.<BR>2. Evaluate an 
      advisory committee meeting.</P>
      <P align=center><B>BEFORE YOU START RECRUITING COMMITTEE MEMBERS</B></P>
      <P>Take a look at your organization's mission statement (module E-13) and 
      philosophy (E-14). These two documents tell your purpose, how you are 
      organized, how you operate, and what you offer. If you do not have a clear 
      mission statement or organizational philosophy, you should consider 
      writing them as an activity of your organization. They will help you to 
      form the committee and to recruit specific committee members.</P>
      <P>Next make a list of your organization's stakeholder groups. 
      Stakeholders are groups or categories of individuals who are affected by 
      your organization's success or failure. List groups and organizations who 
      are involved in programs of your organization that are currently important 
      and likely to continue. List groups which might be important resources to 
      new programs that are proposed for your organization. Consider the 
      geographic region that your organization serves. Should you have 
      representation on your advisory committee from each distinct part of that 
      region? Consider client groups (and potential new clients), gender, ethnic 
      groups, age categories, socio-economic categories, and any other category 
      or group that should be represented on your advisory committee. Make a 
      list of these groups in a column on the left third of a sheet of paper. It 
      might look something like this for a youth soccer program: 
      <DL>
        <DD>High school teacher 
        <DD>Primary school teacher 
        <DD>Parks and Rec. Committee 
        <DD>Interested Parents 
        <DD>Business (Potential Sponsor) 
        <DD>County 4-H agent 
        <DD>Towns involved: </FONT>
        <DL>
          <DD><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sedona</FONT> 
          <DD><FONT face="Times New Roman">Cottonwood</FONT> 
          <DD><FONT face="Times New Roman">Camp Verde</FONT> </DD></DL><FONT 
        face="Times New Roman">
        <DD>Jerome 
        <DD>Native Americans 
        <DD>Hispanics 
        <DD>Kiwanis 
        <DD>Youth (teen)
        <DL>
          <DD>(pre-teen) </DD></DL>
        <DD>Pop Warner Program </DD></DL>
      <P>Take plenty of time to make certain the list is complete. Then begin 
      writing names in the middle third of your sheet of paper. You will find 
      that some names will fit in more than one category. Draw a line from the 
      name to each of the categories that it fits. More lines (categories) to a 
      particular name may mean that this is a stronger candidate for the 
      committee. You should be able to pick your top candidate from the list at 
      this point. Now <U>avoid</U> a common mistake in forming advisory 
      committees. Avoid the temptation to choose six more people who look just 
      like your top candidate (why have six people if they are alike). On the 
      contrary, look for contrasts and complements in your second candidate, 
      then the third, etc. The idea is to end up with a committee (five or seven 
      is a good number) that cover all (or most) of the categories <U>yet can 
      work together</U>.</P>
      <P>Now you are ready to recruit. Refer to module V-3. There you will find 
      instructions that use the other third of the worksheet you have started 
      above.</P>
      <P align=center><B>THE FIRST MEETING</B></P>
      <P>Carefully consider the agenda for the first meeting after forming the 
      advisory committee. You will want to be certain that all members know each 
      other and why each was appointed to the committee. They need to know the 
      purpose of the advisory committee and any limitations on its power. They 
      need to know how it fits in your overall organization. Make certain that 
      each member has an opportunity to express any concerns or ideas that have 
      been brought to the meeting (sometimes friends and associates have 
      requested that a specific matter be discussed). A job description for 
      committee members may be developed at this point (if you did not already 
      use one in the recruitment). If you are developing a job description for 
      the first time, refer to module V-2. You may also want to introduce some 
      ground rules for advisory committee meetings (see module L-3). Most of 
      advisory committee work is done in meetings so the following checklist (in 
      addition to the one in module L-3) may be helpful.</P>
      <P align=center><B>ADVISORY GROUP MEETING CHECKLIST</B></P>
