      <H2 align=justify>Managing Conflict M-3</H2><I>
      <P>An ignorant person has little tolerance.</I></P>
      <P>Every community group experiences conflict from time to time. There 
      will be differences which arise between individuals (or factions) within 
      the group, as well as between group members and interests outside the 
      group. The ability to manage and ultimately resolve conflict is essential 
      to the development of effective relationships, whether within the family, 
      at work or in community groups. </P><B>
      <P align=center>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES:</B></P>
      <P>1. Identify causes of conflict. <BR>2. Recognize different ways of 
      managing conflict.<BR>3. Resolve conflict through collaboration.<BR>4. Use 
      the skills of third party mediation.</P><B>
      <P align=center>CAUSES OF CONFLICT</B></P>
      <P>Conflicts occur because people care, because something that is 
      important to them is threatened--their ideas, their values, their goals, 
      their success, their relationships. Most conflict has one or more of the 
      following causes.</P><U>
      <P>Misunderstanding</U>. Conflicting parties may simply misunderstand each 
      other or the situation. They may not communicate clearly. They may not 
      listen carefully. They may not have all the facts or the right facts about 
      the issue. Most conflict is based in miscommunication.</P><U>
      <P>Disagreement</U> about the nature of the issue and its solution. The 
      world is seen differently by every person, and while that is an exciting 
      aspect of the human condition, the conflicts of these differences are 
      inevitable.</P><U>
      <P>The organizational situation itself</U>. Conflict is likely when 
      authority and responsibilities within the group are not clear, when roles 
      are poorly defined, when group goals are uncertain or when group 
      procedures are unclear or unreasonable.</P><U>
      <P>Personal needs are threatened</U>. All of us have certain needs and 
      interests. Every group member enters into a group to meet some personal 
      need or want. When that need or want is threatened or perceived to be 
      threatened, members lash out at what they see as the source--group 
      officers, leaders, co-members, the institution, etc.</P><B>
      <P align=center>WAYS OF MANAGING CONFLICT</B></P>
      <P align=left>There are many ways of managing conflict. To manage conflict 
      is different than resolving conflict. To manage it is to hold it in 
      control, to keep it from getting out of hand, but it will not necessarily 
      get rid of it. All of us as individuals have ways in which we manage the 
      conflicts in our lives. As members of an organization or group, we also 
      have ways of managing conflict either individually or corporately.</P>
      <P align=left>Each of us handles conflict differently. I may choose to 
      ignore conflict, hoping the issue will go away. I may blame the conflict 
      on someone else. I may deny that there is any conflict. I may confront or 
      attack the other person. I may use persuasion to convince that person that 
      I'm right. I can also choose to work with that person, one-on-one, to 
      manage the conflict to our mutual satisfaction. I might also seek the 
      services of a third party to help mediate the conflict.</P>
      <P align=left>Our effectiveness in dealing with conflict is largely 
      dependent on how we choose to react to it. We have basically three 
      choices. (1) Let it pass and forget it, hopefully without resentment. (2) 
      Work to improve the relationship which may require considerable effort and 
      emotional energy. (3) Attack, depreciate or terminate the relationship, 
      and be willing to live with the consequences. We can either whine, 
      undermine, shine or recline. It is our choice.</P>
      <P align=center>Some of the approaches we may use to manage conflict 
      are:</P><U>
      <P align=left>Avoid involvement in the conflict</U>. There are times when 
      we simply don't want to get involved. We may feel the issue is not worth 
      it or we don't have the energy to involve ourselves in it. We may use this 
      method to keep ourselves out of the conflict and leave it to others to 
      handle. The risk is that the decisions made may not be of our liking or 
      the conflict may mushroom into a larger issue, drawing us into it whether 
      we like it or not. Groups as an entity may choose to avoid a conflict and 
      it may go away, especially if it's a trivial issue. In other situations, 
      the group may find that the conflict is growing, requiring more time and 
      more skill to handle it.</P><U>
      <P align=left>Give someone responsibility to solve the conflict</U>. When 
      time is short, responsibility may be given to a group's officer or 
      committee leader or another person in charge to make a decision. This 
      takes the burden off of us as group members or off of the group as a 
      whole. It is an effective strategy when time is short and the group has a 
      great deal of trust in those who will make the decision. The risks of this 
      approach are obvious. In the long run, this method can create highly 
      frustrated and dependent group members. Also, the short range choice may 
      prove not to be a very good one.</P><U>
      <P align=left>Confrontation</U>. There are times when direct confrontation 
      is necessary to bring your needs, interests, or concern to the attention 
      of another. The other person or group may be unaware or insensitive to 
      your needs or the impact of their behavior on you, or they may be avoiding 
      or denying the conflict. In either case, you may need to assertively speak 
      up for yourself, to "rattle their cage," before conflict management can 
      begin. We often avoid such confrontation for fear of what might happen. To 
      use this approach we need skills and experience in how to confront in a 
      positive, caring manner.</P><U>
      <P align=left>Compromise</U>. Compromising means all parties discuss the 
      issue and then accept the minimum they can all live with in order to stop 
      the conflict. The goal is to stop the conflict quickly rather than 
      thoroughly working out the basic conflict issues. The risk is that 
      compromise may stop this conflict situation but leave the door open for 
      similar or even larger manifestations of the conflict later.</P><U>
      <P align=left>Collaboration</U>. This process ultimately is the most 
      effective in managing group conflict, but it can be a time consuming 
      process. It also requires that the parties involved be willing to work 
      together at resolution. The benefit of collaboration is that a good and 
      long lasting solution is found which addresses the root causes of the 
      disagreement. To collaborate, those in conflict state their goals, their 
      needs in the conflict and then listen to the other parties do the same. 
      They then attempt to work through the conflict to a mutually satisfactory 
      outcome. In collaboration, the parties involved attempt to understand the 
      root causes and basic issues of the problem from the perspective and goals 
      of the other, and then work together to find a mutually acceptable 
      long-range solution. (The skills of collaboration will be described 
      later.</P><U>
      <P align=left>Coercion</U>. Often in conflict situations we find ourselves 
      trying to control others, to impose our will or our way on them. We have 
      concluded that</P>
      <P align=left>the other party is either ignorant, hard-headed or a 
      troublemaker. We don't have the time nor patience to practice the 
      prescribed skills and "besides it wouldn't do any good anyway." We have 
      allowed the relationship to deteriorate. Power politics or majority rule 
      may be used in our attempt to coerce others. Such strategies can produce 
      short-term gain but often at considerable cost to the individuals 
      involved, with destructive long-term effects on the group or community. No 
      one likes to be pushed around or taken advantage of.</P><B>
      <P align=center>SKILLS IN CONFLICT MANAGEMENT</B></P>
      <P>For the effective management and perhaps ultimate resolution of 
      conflict, there are two skills which are absolutely necessary--<U>active 
      listening</U>, and the clear sharing of concerns through 
      "<U>I-statements".</U></P><U>
      <P>LISTEN</U>:</P>
      <P>The area in which we most often fall short in our efforts to manage 
      conflict is in listening. We fail to <U>really</U> listen to the other 
      person--his needs, wants, concerns, fears and the feelings behind them. 
      Rather than listen, we come on strong. We confront, argue, defend, use 
      power and influence to overwhelm the other person. We feel we have heard 
      and understand the other person's view. We thus focus on getting our point 
      across. We try to convince the other person of how right we are. We bring 
      rational, logical ideas to bear, but with limited results.</P>
      <P>In order to effectively manage conflict, we first have to listen. This 
      means:</P>
      <P>* <U>Stop talking</U>.</P>
      <P>* <U>Give the person your total attention</U>. You are not listening if 
      you are thinking about what you are going to say next. Clearly show 
      through your actions that you wish to listen.</P>
      <P>* <U>Invite the person to share</U> thoughts, feelings, frustrations 
      about the issue at hand. Use phrases such as "Tell me about it," "Go on," 
      "Good point," or "Please explain what you meant by..... "Seek to clarify 
      the person's needs, interests and concerns.</P>
      <P>* <U>Reflect</U>, that is, summarize back to the person what has been 
      said. "You feel....." "You are concerned with....." Reflect the feelings 
      as well as the words spoken, e.g., "You were quite annoyed over....." 
      Paraphrase, don't parrot. Reflective listening clearly shows you are 
      listening, develops rapport, and "nips in the bud" miscommunication.</P>
      <P>* <U>Show genuine interest</U>. Not until the other person feels 
      listened to, understood and respected will she be open to your 
      views.</P><U>
      <P>I-MESSAGES</U>:</P>
      <P>Active listening is key to your effectiveness in conflict management. 
      Conflict is not, however, resolved through listening alone. You must also 
      clearly convey your opinion, needs, concerns and feelings--hopefully to 
      the other person' s understanding and respect. Only then can collaborative 
      problem solving begin.</FONT></P>

      <P>Once you have expressed your concern, stop. Your silence allows the 
      other person to think about what you have said, and to speak whatever is 
      on his mind. Seek feedback. The information you receive through listening 
      may overcome a misconception or otherwise modify your need to pursue the 
      issue further. Counter any defensive response with reflective listening. 
      Summarize back in your own words what you understood the person's verbal 
      message and feelings to be: "You feel....." "You think....." "I can see 
      your point." When people become defensive, it is generally useless to keep 
      hammering at them with further I-messages. Instead, take time to listen. 
      Restore mutual respect.</P>
      <P>Most conflict is resolved through a simple process of shifting back and 
      forth from active listening to I-messages, back to listening and more I 
      messages as we seek to clarify and understand each other's needs and 
      concerns and the feelings behind them. As you begin to understand more 
      completely one anther's points of view, you move on to collaborative 
      problem solving--to the resolution of the conflict. The key is our 
      willingness to be involved in the process of listening and sharing clear 
      I-messages. For more information on I-messages see Dr. Thomas Gordon, 
      <U>Parent Effectiveness</U> <U>Training</U> 1970, 1975, A Plume Book; Dr. 
      Robert Bolton, <U>People Skills</U>, 1979, Prentice-Hall.</P><B>
      <P align=center>MANAGEMENT VERSUS RESOLUTION</B></P>
      <P>The <U>management</U> of conflict, as covered above, is the first step. 
      If we can manage conflict effectively, we can keep it from getting out of 
      hand. By deciding to do nothing or by letting someone else solve the 
      problem, or through active listening or compromise we can manage conflict. 
      None of these approaches, however, will insure resolution of the conflict. 
      Below we will develop skills in conflict <U>resolution.</U><B></P>
      <P align=center>COLLABORATION</B></P>
      <P>Conflicts can be resolved <U>only</U> if conflicting parties are 
      willing to participate in the process of resolution. It is hard work, but 
      when the process is used, it is effective and those involved feel positive 
      about the outcome. The following six steps are a general guide for 
      effective conflict resolution. Each conflict is unique, and it is 
      important to adapt the process to fit specific circumstances.</P><U>
      <P>STEP ONE: ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY</U></P>
      <P>Only as the individuals involved accept responsibility to do something 
      about a conflict can anything be done. A decision has to be made as to 
      whether this conflict can be resolved and whether you as an individual or 
      group want to resolve it. In deciding, consider: (1) Is the person with 
      whom I have the conflict important to me? (2) Is this issue important 
      enough to work on? (3) Will talking about it improve our relationship? (4) 
      Am I willing to spend the time necessary to resolve it? (5) Do I have the 
      emotional energy necessary to work on it at this time?</P>
      <P>If the answers are yes, then approach the other parties in the conflict 
      to see if they are willing to work on resolution. If they are, proceed 
      with the process. If they are not willing, you have only one choice, which 
      is to try to manage the conflict. </P>
      <P>There will be times when you do not perceive a problem. But if the 
      other person says "I have a problem" or indicates such through her actions 
      then there is a conflict that needs to be worked out. It takes both 
      parties willing to resolve the conflict for the process to work.</P>
      <P>If in considering the above questions some of your answers are no, you 
      may decide to avoid the issue at this time or take other action. There are 
      times when you may not want to take the time or spend the energy to 
      resolve the conflict and you will instead choose to manage it as best you 
      can at that time. All of us do this from time to time, but it is easy to 
      build up resentments when there is no resolution.</P>
      <P>As you enter into the process, some basic beliefs about conflict 
      resolution should be kept in mind (Filley, 1975, pp. 60-71): belief in 
      cooperation rather in competition; belief that everyone is of equal value; 
      belief in the views of others as legitimate statements of their position; 
      belief that differences of opinion are helpful; and belief in the 
      trustworthiness of those involved.</P><U>
      <P>STEP TWO: SET THE STAGE</U></P>
      <P>Preparation is essential if the process is to be effective. Approach 
      the process as calmly as possible. Emotions are a part of any conflict and 
      must be dealt with, as we shall discuss later. If emotions are out of 
      control, however, wait until the parties involved can cool down. Schedule 
      a time later that day or the next to discuss the conflict in order to set 
      up the process for resolution. Some guidelines for the process are:</P>
      <P><U>Establish a date and time</U> which will provide enough quality time 
      to get through the process. Since each conflict is different, there is no 
      way to set an exact amount of time needed. Agree at the beginning to work 
      for a set period of time at the end of which another time will be set if 
      there is no resolution.</P>
      <P><U>Choose a place</U> to meet which is comfortable and private. A 
      neutral location, one not associated with either party, is best The place 
      needs to be quiet.</P>
      <P><U>Let the other person know that you respect him and his concerns</U>. 
      If there is no respect between the parties, resolution cannot likely 
      occur.</P>
      <P><U>Decide the roles each person will play</U> in the process. If the 
      conflict involves several people, decide if all will take part in the 
      process or if there will be a spokesperson for the conflicting interests. 
      If a mediator or a arbitrator is involved with the parties, clarify that 
      role.</P>
      <P>Agree to work on <U>only one issue at a time</U>.</P><U>
      <P>STEP THREE: CLARIFY THE PROBLEM</U></P>
      <P>A common mistake individuals (and groups) make in trying to resolve 
      conflict is to focus immediately on solutions to the problem. We spend our 
      time debating the pros and cons of each--before the underlying problem is 
      clearly stated or understood by all parties. For conflict resolution to 
      occur, time must first be taken to clarify the problem from each 
      party's</P>
      <P>perspective. Effective problem solvers spend proportionately more time 
      in problem definition than in problem-solving. The most effective way to 
      approach conflict resolution is first to discuss the problem, <U>then</U> 
      discuss its resolution.</P>
      <P>In every conflict there are feelings and these MUST be dealt with 
      BEFORE the problem can be solved. To resolve conflict, focus first on the 
      emotional aspects--the anger, distrust, defensiveness, resentment, fear 
      and rejection. Full expression of feeling is an essential part of the 
      problem clarification process. If the emotions get too high, either take a 
      break or set another time, but they should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>A number of methods can be used in this clarification step of the 
      process. One is illustrated below. It can be used by two individuals or by 
      a large number. If there is a large group and everyone wishes to speak, it 
      is recommended that a mediator be used. If there is a large group and each 
      conflicting party has selected a spokesperson, a mediator may or may not 
      be needed. (The role of the mediator is described later in this 
      module.)</P>
      <P>In the clarification of the problem, the skills of active listening and 
      I-messages, as described above, can be used throughout the process.</P>
      <P><U>Decide who will speak first</U>. All persons involved are to have an 
      equal opportunity to talk.</P>
      <P><U>Person A speaks</U> for a set amount of time (five to ten minutes). 
      Stick to one specific issue. Use I-statements to describe your feelings, 
      "I was hurt by . . .," etc. Describe specifically the 
      behavior/issue/action which is of concern. Avoid loaded words. Eliminate 
      sarcasm, blame, exaggeration and judgements from your statements. Say what 
      you mean. Mean what you say!</P>
      <P><U>Person B listens</U> to A <U>without interruption</U>.</P>
      <P>Upon A's completion, <U>B summarizes</U> back to A what was said 
      without mixing in his own thoughts, ideas or interpretation. If A feels 
      that B has not heard and understood, A clarifies while B again listens. 
      This continues until A feels the message has been heard.</P>
      <P><U>Person B</U> then <U>speaks</U> for the allotted period of time.</P>
      <P><U>Person A listens and summarizes</U> back.</P>
      <P><U>Person B acknowledges</U> having been heard.</P>
      <P>This process continues for as long as both parties have anything to say 
      on the issue. It is important to stay with one issue even though the 
      temptation will be to bring up more. As others arise, write them down for 
      discussion at another time. If there are several persons to speak on the 
      problem, then move from one side to the other with each side listening as 
      stated above before continuing.</P>
      <P>Often, having heard all sides of a problem and vented feelings, 
      conflicted parties will recognize an immediate resolution, acceptable to 
      all. At this point parties can move quickly to step six. More likely, 
      parties will need to proceed with steps four and five.</P>
      <P>It is this step in the process that is most important. If the problem 
      in conflict is not fully explored and clarified so that all parties 
      understand each other's position, it is doubtful there will be 
      resolution.</P><U>
      <P>STEP FOUR: SEARCH FOR COMMON GOALS</U></P>
      <P>Clearly identify what is most important to each party in the conflict. 
      In every conflict, there are goals which are held in common. People may 
      disagree strongly about how a job should be done, but probably agree that 
      they want the job done. They may have trouble working as a team, but 
      probably agree that if they could work well together all would benefit. It 
      is easier to mobilize joint problem-solving when common goals have been 
      identified.</P>
      <P>During the process of step three, some common goals (needs, concerns, 
      frustrations) will come out. Identify these as they come up, stating your 
      agreement. What will emerge is a more narrow specific focus of the 
      conflict, which is then easier to resolve. </P><U>
      <P>STEP FIVE: COLLABORATE IN PROBLEM-SOLVING</U></P>
      <P>Only after step three has been fully completed can step five work. Only 
      to the extent that there is clarification of the problem can it be 
      resolved. The next step is collaborative (joint) problem-solving:</P>
      <P>You want ___________________________. I (we) want 
      _____________________________.</P>
      <P><U>Brainstorm possible solutions</U>. In order to keep conflicting 
      parties from prematurely adopting and fighting over solutions, 
      brainstorming is used to generate as many solutions as possible to the 
      conflict. The rules of brainstorming include generating as many solutions 
      as possible without regard to their feasibility. </P>
      <P>Think creatively. Don't discuss or argue or question these possible 
      solutions at this time. Just make a list of them. Brainstorming will fail 
      when emotions resurface and people insist on evaluating the suggested 
      solutions as they are brainstormed. This means that the clarification of 
      the problem hasn't been completed and parties need to return to step 
      three.</P>
      <P><U>Evaluate the possible solutions</U>. After both parties are 
      satisfied that an adequate number of options has been proposed, then 
      evaluate them. Each party asks questions about each proposed solution so 
      they understand what is meant. Each party has the right to mark off any of 
      the solutions that are unacceptable to them stating honestly why they are 
      not acceptable.</P>
      <P>If most of the solutions get marked off, go back and brainstorm more 
      options. As each alternative is discussed, look for a solution which 
      integrates and builds on the best aspects of each. Modify and combine 
      solutions to come up with a better solution.</P>
      <P><U>Decide on a solution</U>. Often an original solution will emerge and 
      will be recognized and immediately accepted by all parties. If that does 
      not happen and a list of several possible and acceptable solutions 
      remains, then each conflicting party should take paper and, in priority 
      order (1-2-3), write down what each considers the best solution. Lists are 
      then shared. Usually one or two acceptable solutions will appear on each 
      list. Since they are acceptable, take one solution and act on it. If 
      arguments persist at this point as to which solution to act on, the 
      process has not worked and parties need to go back to step three.</P><U>
      <P>STEP SIX: AGREE ON A PLAN OF ACTION</U></P>
      <P>Having decided to implement one solution, parties need to decide 
      <U>who</U> will do <U>what, when, how often,</U> etc. Set a time limit (if 
      applicable) as to how long this solution will be tried (usually several 
      weeks or months). Schedule another meeting to continue the discussion and 
      evaluate progress. If the solution is working, continue. If the solution 
      has not worked, go back and repeat the process. If the other party does 
      not follow through on her commitment, confront the person (using the 
      confrontation skills learned in Chapter 9): "Hey, I don't feel it's fair 
      to me that I stuck to my end of the bargain but you didn't. I thought we 
      had our problem solved, and I'm irritated that we apparently haven't." 
      Don't threaten penalties or punishment. Then go back to step three.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee that the problem will be satisfactorily resolved 
      as a result of this process, though it usually is. It does ensure, 
      however, that all persons involved will have a better understanding of the 
      issue. Persons, having been heard, usually feel better about each other 
      and the issue, even when it is not resolved.</P><U>
      <P>An option</U>: Some people find it easier to <U>write</U> about the 
      problem/issue which concerns them. In such cases, each person writes down 
      what she thinks the problem/issue is and her feelings and thought about 
      it. These papers are then exchanged, read and each person writes back to 
      the other about what has been learned. This process continues until both 
      parties agree that the problem has been clarified. At this point (or 
      earlier if agreed by both parties) the process needs to move from a 
      written to a verbal exchange. This option is found to work especially well 
      for families with adolescents.</P><B>
      <P align=center>MEDIATION</B></P>
      <P>Conflict resolution can often be assisted by a third party mediator. 
      From time to time each of us will have the opportunity to serve as a 
      mediator in helping others work out differences.</P>
      <P>To be helpful, the mediator must remain neutral. The role of mediator 
      is similar to that of a traffic cop. His responsibility is to direct 
      traffic, not promote a given solution or solve the problem for the other 
      parties. The mediator suggests different approaches to resolving the 
      conflict, insures an open and balanced conversation flow, enforces ground 
      rules and protects the individuals involved from personal attack. The 
      mediator treats everyone as a responsible adult, and does not judge or 
      parent. The mediator controls the PROCESS by which decisions are made, but 
      not the CONTENT of those decisions.</P>
      <P>The mediator is effective only as long as he or she is trusted by both 
      sides of the conflict. If the mediator intervenes on behalf of a given 
      solution, credibility is lost. It is best not to assume the mediator role 
      on issues on which you have a strong opinion. Adherence to the following 
      steps will increase your effectiveness:</P><U>
      <P>Clarify your role</U> as a mediator. This can be done either formally 
      or informally. For example, "There seem to be strong differences of 
      opinion on this. Can we work together to explore alternatives until we 
      find a solution that is agreeable to everyone? I wish to remain neutral 
      and try to serve as a discussion facilitator in helping you work it out to 
      your mutual satisfaction. Is that agreeable?"</P>
      <P>As chairperson or just a member of the group, you may choose to 
      intervene, and ultimately assume the role of mediator. On other occasions, 
      you may offer to serve such a role in able to facilitate discussion. As 
      you become known for your mediation skills, the group will ask you to 
      serve that role when needed. Initially, some form of personal intervention 
      is often necessary to initiate the mediation process. Often it is helpful 
      to call a break to allow emotions to cool, and then initiate the mediation 
      process when you come back.</P><U>
      <P>Set rules for discussion</U>. For example, "I would like each side to 
      clearly state its concern and desires with no interruptions. Then the 
      other side must summarize its <B>understanding </B>of what was said to the 
      other party's satisfaction before stating its concern and desires (and 
      rebuttal). This will continue until both sides feel they have been 
      understood."</P>
      <P>Clarify the ground rules (e.g., equal time for each side; no 
      interruptions; we will work until we find a solution that is agreeable to 
      both sides; be respectful; no put downs; keep to one issue). You may wish 
      to set time limits on how long each person (side) can speak before having 
      to give up the floor to the other side (five to ten minutes is 
      suggested).</P><U>
      <P>Clarify underlying problems, objectives, needs and desires</U>. For 
      example, "Bob, would you please summarize for me your concern (what you 
      see the problem to be, what you hope to accomplish through this)?"</P><B>
      <P>Combat "solution-mindedness" </B>(the tendency of people to propose 
      solutions before agreement has been reached as to the problem). Focus 
      attention on problems to be solved rather than on proposals, 
      recommendations or solutions to be approved. When solutions are proposed 
      in this stage of the process, ask the person to define specifically what 
      she wishes to accomplish with the proposal. Continue your questioning 
      until a problem, goal or obstacle is defined. <U>Probe</U>, (e.g., "I'm 
      not clear why.....," "What do you hope to accomplish with.....?"). 
      Defining and reaching agreement on the problem is 75% of the solution.</P>
      <P>Encourage the sharing of feelings, the airing of emotions. Get 
      everything out in the open. Only after the "real" problem has been clearly 
      defined can a cooperative search for solutions. Be an active and 
      supportive listener. Summarize the words and feelings expressed: "Mary 
      feels we should....." "Bob suggests....." "Jill, you were disappointed 
      in....." "John, you feel their motive is to....."</P>
      <P>Use feedback to check for accuracy of communications. <B>Focus the 
      </B>conflict on facts rather than on hearsay and speculation. Accept the 
      views and feelings of each individual as legitimate. Don't judge. 
      Empathize.</P>
      <P>Call on individuals from the other side to summarize their 
      understanding of what was just said. Have the parties communicate directly 
      to each other rather than through you. An important role of<I> </I>the 
      mediator is to slow down the discussion and get each side listening to the 
      other. Only after both sides state they feel they have been understood do 
      you <B>proceed to the </B>next step.</P><U>
      <P>Brainstorm alternatives</U>: The mediator helps a group that is bogged 
      down in arguing the pros and cons of a given proposal (solution) to 
      consider other approaches. Set aside a period of time for brainstorming. 
      Get both parties to agree that during the brainstorming no discussion or 
      evaluation of the alternatives suggested will be permitted. People will be 
      <B>more willing to </B>suggest new approaches if they are protected 
      against ridicule and criticism. If possible, list these alternatives <B>on 
      newsprint </B>or<B> </B>blackboard for all to see. See module LT-3 for 
      specific directions for brainstorming.</P>
      <P>Seek to expand possible alternatives. Encourage both parties to search 
      for other acceptable solutions, e.g., "What other approach might work?" 
      Focus attention on defeating the <B>problem rather </B>than each 
other.</P>
      <P>At this point, the <B>mediator might also suggest alternatives. 
      </B>Care should be taken, however, to express those suggestions through 
      questions. "Have you thought out.....?" <B>"Would it help </B>if.....?" 
      "How about.....?" This questioning technique involves the mediator in 
      identifying possible alternatives <U>with</U> the conflicting parties, in 
      contrast to developing "answers" <U>for</U> the conflicting parties. The 
      mediator must remain neutral.</P>
      <P>Evaluate the alternatives. Eliminate and modify the identified 
      alternatives until a solution is found <B>that is agreeable to both 
      </B>sides. The mediator identifies and builds on common concerns and 
      focuses attention on points of agreement. "It seems that both of you share 
      a concern for....." "There appears to be agreement on ....."</P>
      <P>Where disagreement remains, the mediator helps clarify those 
      differences and seeks to modify the identified alternatives to overcome 
      stated objections. For example, "Side A, what is it about ..... that is 
      not acceptable to you?" "OK, side B, what might be done to overcome that 
      concern?" "Side A, would that be agreeable with you?"</P>
      <P>The mediator should continue to use the questioning technique to 
      identify further alternatives and to seek compromise. "Would it be 
      acceptable to you if .....?" "Would you (side A) be willing to....., if 
      you (side B) did .....?" Seek a solution that both parties would be 
      willing to give a trial run.</P><U>
      <P>Clarify the implementation </U>strategy, once an agreement has been 
      reached. Agree on a test period after which further<B> </B>modifications 
      can be made if the selected approach is not working. Clarify what success 
      is to look like.</P><U>
      <P>Reflect on group behavior</U>. At times, it may be necessary to 
      confront the group on its behavior. Freeze the discussion long enough to 
      focus attention on the general behavior of<B> </B>the group<B>. </B>"I'm 
      picking up a take it or leave it attitude. This troubles me." Don't single 
      out individuals. If an individual continues with disruptive, annoying 
      behavior, wait for a break, then take the person aside and share your 
      perceptions with him in<B> </B>an open, frank but caring manner. Serve as 
      a mirror in heightening the group's awareness of its own behavior and the 
      possible consequences of such behavior. Suggest alternatives.</P>
      <P>If the discussion gets heated, reflect on what is happening, and then 
      call for a break. If the discussion becomes emotional, it probably 
      indicates the need to go back to clarifying the problem and underlying 
      feelings.</P>
      <P>If conducted properly, mediation can be very helpful in resolving 
      conflict in family, work and community situations.</P><B>

      <P>Part</U> I: Several conflict or potential conflict situations are 
      described below. Review each, and indicate how you might handle the 
      situation using the techniques prescribed in this module.</P>
      <P><U>Situation 1</U>: Joe is hot under the collar. He keeps interrupting, 
      arguing against the proposal under discussion. He is dominating the 
      discussion and keeping others from being heard. As a member of the group,

      would use. </P>
      <P><U>Situation 2</U>: How do you handle people who say they'll do

      Chamber of Commerce. Clint is chairman of the Retail Promotion Committee. 
      The year is half over and the committee has only met once. Clint had 
      promised a big promotion in the summer; but it turned out to be a hastily 
      conceived, poorly coordinated sidewalk sale with poor customer 
      turn-out.</P>
      <P>1. Draft several I-statements that might be used to confront in a firm 
      but caring manner.</P>
      <P>2. From your own experiences, pencil in what you think Clint will say 
      in responding to your I-statements. Consider the following:</P>

      <P><U>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Situation</U> 3: The City Parks and Recreation Commission is holding 
      its regular monthly meeting. The major topic on the agenda is a larger 
      swimming pool. This item has been a part of the agenda at summer meetings 
      of the commission for several years, but has been<B> </B>consistently 
      voted down. This year Tom Donavan, an influential banker in the community 
      and recently appointed to the Commission, has taken upon himself the task 
      of pushing for the pool. He is opposed by Carol Watson who feels there is 
      a much greater need for tennis courts. Another member of the commission, 
      Bill Valenzuela, has been the swing vote for several years, and he doesn't 
      like the emotional bickering.</P>
      <P>Tom: (Heatedly) We must get a new swimming pool. The old one is 
      overcrowded. It is becoming both a health and safety hazard. It is the 
      most used recreational facility in this town. For five years we haven't 
      done anything about it. Now is the time.</P>
      <P>Carol: But it is only used for a few months each year--five months at 
      the most. If we had tennis courts, we could use them year around. We need 
      them worse than a new swimming pool.</P>
      <P>Tom: The high school has courts. People can use them.</P>
      <P>Carol: They don't have lights. They are run down and some people think 
      they are only for students and won't use them. </P>
      <P>Bill: Maybe we need to study this issue a bit more. It can't hurt to 
      get more information.</P>
      <P>1. If you were Carol, what approaches might you take to better manage, 
      and hopefully resolve, this conflict? List at least five options.</P>
      <P>2. Review your list, and categorize each according to one of the six 
      approaches to managing conflict described earlier.</P>
      <P>3. Evaluate each of the listed options. Indicate the pros and cons of 
      each in the space below. Star (*) the option that you feel would be most 
      effective in managing this conflict.</P>
      <P>4. Use the space below to rewrite Carol's two responses to Tom. 
      Indicate the <U>listening phrases</U> she might use to restore respect and 
      open communication.</P>
      <P>5. Having used the listening skills to show respect and<B> 
      </B>understanding, indicate below the phrases Carol might now use in 
      setting the stage for <U>collaborative</U> problem-solving (review the six 
      steps for collaboration in conflict resolution).</P>
      <P>6. What are some common goals that might bring Tom and Carol<B> 
      </B>together?</P>
      <P>7. Brainstorm, below, a list of alternative solutions that might be 
      acceptable to <U>both</U> Carol and Tom in moving from a win/lose to a 
      win/win situation. List at least five.</P>
      <P>8. Assume that you are the fourth member of this commission. How would 
      you go about trying to mediate this conflict? Indicate the phrases you 
      would use.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Part II: </STRONG></P>
      <P>If you are in a study group, break into groups of three. Review the 
      three situations. Compare and discuss your responses to each of the 
      questions.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. Role play situation 2. One of you is to play Clint<B> </B>as 
        described in the situation statement. One of you is to be the president 
        of the Chamber of Commerce, and confront Clint with the prescribed three 
        part I statement. Clint is to respond to the confrontation in a 
        defensive manner. The Chamber president is to then respond with 
        appropriate active listening. Shift from active listening to 
        I-statements and back again as appropriate. Keep the role play going for 
        at least five minutes. Clint can make up his own details. The third
