      <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">A strong rooster can sing in 
      any chicken coop. (a weak plan won't work anywhere)</FONT></I></P>
      <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">Relevant objectives can be 
      written only after issues are identified (module E-5), then turned into 
      priorities (module E-6) which are then stated as goals. These steps are 
      described in module E-4 on program planning. You may wish to read (reread) 
      those modules. Completing module E-6 will give you a set of goals (general 
      statements of intent). Now you are ready to turn these goals into specific 
      objectives which will be the key part of the plan of work that you write 
      in module E-9.<B>&nbsp;</B></FONT></P><B>
      <P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman">LEARNING 
      OBJECTIVES</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">After completing this module you should be 
      able to:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. Describe the criteria for a useful 
      specific objective.<BR>2. Identify objectives which do not meet the 
      criteria.<BR>3. Write specific objectives which can be 
      evaluated.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">EXERCISE:</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Write from 1 to 3 specific objectives for 
      each goal. To get started, look at the objectives described in step III of 
      the program planning process described in module E-4. You may also refer 
      to the "learning objectives" at the beginning of this module. Use the 
      check sheet below to evaluate each objective and rewrite until each 
      objective meets all criteria on the check sheet. Work with a partner to 
      evaluate the objectives that you have written alone. Be patient if this 
      exercise seems unnecessarily detailed and boring. Do not cut any 
      corners.</FONT></P>
      <P align=center><STRONG><FONT face="Times New Roman">CHECKLIST TO EVALUATE 
      OBJECTIVES</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The objective should be:</FONT></P><U>
      <P></U><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. <U>Clear</U> - anyone in your 
      organization can understand it. <BR>2. <U>Challenging</U> - requires some 
      effort.<BR>3. <U>Realistic</U> - does not require more time or resources 
      than you have.<BR>4. <U>Specific </U>- it states <U>who</U> does 
      <U>what</U> by <U>when</U>.<BR>5. <U>Observable</U> - accomplishment of 
      the objective can be observed; there is no doubt that the objective has 
      been met.<BR><U>6. Measurable - accomplishment of the objective can be 
      measured (you can say that it was 100% accomplished, 50% accomplished, 
      etc.)<BR>7. Simple - complexity is no virtue in writing objectives.<BR>8. 
      Not too confining - there is some flexibility to allow for changes in the 
      overall situation. If the objective can only be achieved under optimum 
      conditions, then it is too confining.</FONT></P></U>
      <P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<B>IN 
      CONCLUSION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Writing objectives is boring to some 
      people who don't like detail work. However, objectives are the key to any 
      plan. Without clear, specific objectives, members don't know where your 
      group is heading. At the very least, you will have a fuzzy plan of work; 
      at the worst you will have complete chaos with everyone going in different 
      directions and getting in each other's way. Objectives are critical in 
      moving from ideas to action. So don't ignore or downplay 
      objectives.</FONT></P><B>
      <P align=center><FONT face="Times New Roman">NEXT STEPS</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Later you will use the objectives as a 
      part of your plan of work (module E-9 and then to evaluate progress 
      (module E-10). The next step in program planning, however, is to assess 
      resources (module E-8). If the resources that you have (or that you can 
      get) are not sufficient to accomplish the objectives that you have 
      written, then you will need to rewrite those objectives to make them more 
      realistic.</FONT>
