      <H2 align=justify>Nonformal Education E-3</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>School isn't the only place where you can learn.</I></P>
      <P>An understanding of nonformal education is essential for any educator 
      who works outside of the classroom. Most of our conscious educational 
      experience comes from schools. Yet if we try to act like classroom 
      teachers when we are outside the classroom, we are likely to have 
      problems. This module will look at the difference between formal and 
      nonformal education with an emphasis on nonformal education.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Explain the difference between formal and nonformal education to 
      someone who does not clearly understand the difference.<BR>2. Plan and 
      teach a topic in a formal classroom and in a nonformal educational setting 
      (i.e. an extension workshop).</P><B>
      <P align=center>WHAT IS NONFORMAL EDUCATION?</B></P>
      <P>According to Philip Coombs (1973) it is</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>...any organized educational activity outside the established formal 
        system--whether operating separately or as an important feature of some 
        broader activity--that is intended to serve some identifiable learning 
        clienteles and learning objectives.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Nonformal education is difficult to define satisfactorily, and some 
      educators even feel that definitions confine more than clarify. Since 
      nonformal educational activities are numerous and diverse, a single 
      definition which applies to all is difficult to develop. Further, because 
      education too often tends to be thought of in terms of schooling, we must 
      be careful to state our assumptions so that this misconception is 
      avoided.</P>
      <P>Certain key dimensions can be identified for particular nonformal 
      educational settings. These dimensions are contextual. They may vary from 
      one educational setting to another. A review of literature on the theory 
      and practice of nonformal education found that six dimensions tend to 
      dominate .</P>
      <P>1. <U>Learner-centered</U> means that emphasis is on learning rather 
      than on teaching. The learner participates in determining educational 
      objectives and exerts substantial control over content and method. 
      Attitudes of self-awareness and power to control environment are fostered. 
      Local initiative, self-help and innovation are encouraged in order to 
      equip learners to analyze critically and take action to resolve their own 
      practical problems.</P>
      <P>2. <U>Cafeteria curriculum</U> (options, variety and flexibility) is 
      featured in place of the sequential, prescribed curriculum associated with 
      schools. Curriculum is generated primarily by learners. A strong 
      entertainment feature is included. Examples include local radio, village 
      newspapers, market day exhibits, posters, mobile libraries, drama, role 
      play, games, puppets and epic narrative. Resources and skills need not be 
      imported or professional.</P>
      <P>3. <U>Informal human relationships</U> are essential. Learners and 
      educators are roles which, ideally, switch back and forth among 
      participants. Informal relations based on mutual respect are necessary if 
      education is to be learner-centered and if learners are to choose from a 
      cafeteria of learning opportunities. While this value position is often 
      difficult for professional teachers to accept, local nonprofessional 
      "facilitators" who see their role as catalyst, helper, or enabler are 
      often more effective than lecturers or academics.</P>
      <P>4. <U>Reliance on local resources</U> means that costs are kept low 
      without sacrificing quality, that both conventional and unconventional 
      sources are used, and that available resources are deployed efficiently. 
      Expensive technology is not necessary and often undesirable. Because 
      learners often bear part of the costs, higher motivation and greater 
      program accountability usually result.</P>
      <P>5. <U>Immediate usefulness</U> refers to educational content and 
      methodology directly related to learners' life styles. Formal schooling 
      often has a delayed impact through its orientation to future application. 
      Nonformal education should involve short term activities with a present 
      time orientation and immediate impact.</P>
      <P>6. <U>Low level of structure</U> is necessary when local situations 
      vary tremendously between and within themselves. Since a high level of 
      structure means a high level of control, learner-centered approaches, 
      informal human relationships and immediate usefulness are all difficult 
      under tightly controlled situations. Flexibility is sacrificed for 
      control. But flexibility is necessary for the needs of individuals, 
      subcultures, and minorities. Voluntary organizations and amateurs who 
      learn on the job are favored over governmental programs featuring 
      bureaucratic approaches managed by civil servants. Decentralization is 
      necessary to allow local approaches to local problems.</P>
      <P>If these six dimensions are carefully considered by nonformal 
      educators, participatory planning and decision making will be much easier. 
      These dimensions need to be considered in the structure of the educational 
      organization, in its mission statement, in its choice of priorities, in 
      its inservice training of educators, and in its use of educational methods 
      and techniques. To be truly effective in the future, nonformal educators 
      will need to shape their organization, both at the national level and at 
      the local community level, to be flexible in responding to the needs of 
      clients rather than requiring clients to adapt to a rigid and unresponsive 
      organization.</P>
      <P>Educators will need to give special attention to the way educational 
      programs are planned. The steps in program planning (see module E-4) do 
      not change with formal and nonformal education. The involvement of people 
      and the techniques used to plan programs collaboratively, however, are 
      strikingly different.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. Extension agents and other nonformal educators often have 
      difficulties when they try to teach a class in a formal educational 
      setting. Likewise, classroom teachers often have difficulties when they 
      try to teach a group of youth or adults who are not part of a formal 
      class. Why is this?<BR>2. Can an educator develop skills to move 
      effectively between the formal classroom and nonformal educational 
      settings? <BR>3. How will this educator behave differently in each 
      setting?</P>
      <P><B>EXERCISE</B></P>
      <P>Chose a topic with which you are very familiar. Write a plan for how 
      you would teach that topic to a group of adults who have finished their 
      formal education and just want to learn about your topic. Then write a 
      second plan for teaching the same topic in a formal classroom for 50 
      minutes. If you have never written a lesson plan for a class or a workshop 
      you may want to look at module C-8 (using learning techniques) for a 
      format to plan a class. The module on workshops (LT-1) gives you two 
      different planning formats.</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Teach the topic that you have just planned in a classroom and in a 
      workshop. Have a colleague evaluate you using the instruments found in 
      E-10 for a workshop and for a classroom session. If possible have a 
      teacher, who is recognized as an effective classroom teacher, evaluate 
      your formal presentation. Have an effective extension agent (or other 
      professional nonformal educator) evaluate the workshop.</FONT> <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
