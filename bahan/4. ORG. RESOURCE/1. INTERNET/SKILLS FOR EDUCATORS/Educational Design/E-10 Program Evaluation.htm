      <H2 align=justify>Program Evaluation E-10</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>If you want life to be easy, you must pay for it.</I></P>
      <P>This is the last step in the program planning process. Yes, evaluation 
      should be considered during the planning process. It should not wait until 
      the program has been completed.</P>
      <P>In order to understand evaluation's place in the program planning 
      process you will need to review module E-4. In order to plan an evaluation 
      correctly it should follow the other steps in program planning (described 
      in modules E-5 through E-9 and M-2).</P>
      <P align=center>&nbsp;<B>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>When<B> </B>you finish this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Define "evaluation."<BR>2. Plan for the evaluation of some aspect of 
      your group's educational program.</P><B>
      <P align=center>EVALUATION DEFINED</B></P>
      <P>Evaluation is simply "a process to determine if objectives have been 
      met." Well written objectives are essential to planning an evaluation. 
      When planning an evaluation, start by reviewing the objectives. If you 
      lack a set of clear, appropriate objectives, you will find it difficult to 
      get agreement on any plan for evaluation.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEVELS OF EVALUATION</B></P>
      <P>Dr. Claude Bennett, Evaluation Specialist, Extension Service, U.S. 
      Department of Agriculture, has outlined seven levels of evaluation which 
      will help us understand the benefits and limitations of particular 
      evaluation techniques and instruments.</P><U>
      <P>1. Resources</U> How many dollars, how many handouts and exhibits, what 
      resource people, what materials did we use in the educational program that 
      we are evaluating?</P><U>
      <P>2. Activities</U> How many planning meetings, demonstrations, 
      workshops, field trips, contests, telephone calls, newspaper articles did 
      we complete?</P><U>
      <P>3. Participants</U> Who participated in the activities that we 
      organized? What were their ages, ethnic backgrounds, gender, 
      socio-economic status, area of residence, organizations represented (and 
      how many of each category)?</P><U>
      <P>4. Reactions</U> Did the participants like the activities? What 
      comments or suggestions did they make regarding the activities?</P><U>
      <P>5. Changes in Knowledge, Attitudes, Skills and Aspirations (KASA)</U> 
      As a result of your program's activities how did the participants improve 
      (or regress) in KASA? Was there really any difference in the participants 
      as a result of the program?</P><U>
      <P>6. Adoption of New Practices</U> Did the participants retain the KASA 
      changes over time? Were these changes of short duration or did they become 
      part of the participants' lifestyles?</P><U>
      <P>7. End Results</U> What were the long term effects of your program on 
      the local community or society in general? Did the number of teen 
      pregnancies decrease? Did the production of wheat (bushels per acre) 
      increase? Were new organizations created? Was the lifestyle of community 
      members improved? Can the improvements be attributed to the educational 
      program that you provided?</P>
      <P>These levels of evaluation represent an increasing time requirement and 
      increasing difficulty for the evaluator. They also represent an increasing 
      value of evaluation results. Determining resources, activities and 
      participants is relatively easy--it can be done by observation and 
      counting. To determine reactions you will need an organized technique (a 
      trained observer/recorder or a post-meeting questionnaire). To determine 
      changes in KASA and adoption of new practices you will need to gather 
      evidence before and after the program in a reliable and valid procedure. 
      End results take time and great sophistication of measurement by 
      evaluators.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if you can gather evidence about changes in KASA or 
      adoption of new practices, you will have stronger evidence for continuing 
      your program or for getting funding for similar programs.</P>
      <P align=center><B>EVALUATION ALTERNATIVES</B></P>
      <P>To most of us, evaluation means completing an evaluation form at the 
      end of a meeting or training program. Other, often more useful, forms of 
      evaluation are described below.</P>
      <P><U>Round Robin</U></P>
      <P>The round robin evaluation simply involves calling on each person in 
      turn to share reactions to a given activity. For example, "What was your 
      evaluation of last week's meeting (4-H horse show, training session)? What 
      did you particularly like, and where might improvements be made?" Appoint 
      a secretary to record responses. An important ground rule is no 
      discussion, except for questions of clarification. This keeps the group 
      from getting bogged down in defending, disputing and discussing individual 
      comments until everyone has been heard. The round robin insures input from 
      everyone, without debate. Once everyone has been called upon, the 
      composite listing can then be discussed, if necessary, and conclusions 
      drawn.</P>
      <P>One of the most commonly used forms of evaluation is a call for public 
      input. The chair (or other official) poses a general question to the group 
      as a whole, e.g., "Any comments on last week's horse show?" Experience 
      shows that only a few people respond to such calls for input. The round 
      robin, in contrast, will insure greater input and involvement. If members 
      find that their input is respected and used, they will be more willing to 
      speak openly in the future, and the quality of evaluation will 
      increase.</P><U>
      <P>Buzz Groups</P></U>
      <P>Buzz groups, often called Process Groups, involve quickly breaking into 
      small groups of two to five people. Each buzz group is to assess the 
      meeting (workshop, etc.). Each person is asked to share his frustrations, 
      concerns, suggestions and satisfaction with how things are going. Where 
      there is consensus, the buzz group should initiate action to improve the 
      meeting or workshop, e.g., propose to the group that..., or talk to the 
      chair about..., or suggest....</P>
      <P>Set a time limit of 15 to 30 minutes for this exercise. One option is 
      to incorporate the process group assignment into an extended break. The 
      advantage of this exercise is that people tend to share more openly in 
      smaller more private groups than they do in larger public groups. Also the 
      focus of the exercise is on action rather than complaints. Periodic 
      process breaks are invaluable in developing a cohesive team spirit along 
      with an added sense of personal responsibility.</P><U>
      <P>Observer</P></U>
      <P>Arrange for one or two individuals to serve as a process observer. They 
      will not enter into the discussion but instead sit back and observe how 
      the meeting is progressing, (i.e., what are the group dynamics, who is and 
      isn't talking, how are decisions made, what team building roles were 
      exhibited). The observer is to identify strengths as well as weaknesses. 
      The checklist provided earlier in this chapter can serve to guide the 
      observer in analyzing a group.</P>
      <P>The observers are then called upon at the end of the meeting to share 
      their observations and suggestions with the group, and to pinpoint team 
      building skills the group could work on. The advantage of designated 
      observers is that they are removed from the operation of the group and can 
      be more systematic and objective in their assessment. It is difficult for 
      individuals who are directly involved in a meeting to step back and 
      critique what is happening.</P><U>
      <P>Review Goals</U></P>
      <P>Every organization should plan time at least quarterly to review its 
      goals and objectives. What has been accomplished? What has not? What 
      adjustments (additions or deletions) need to be made? How do individuals 
      in the group feel about the group's accomplishments? How well is the group 
      (or designated committees) working together to accomplish those goals? Do 
      these goals still reflect the priority interests of group members? What 
      are the group's short-comings?</P>
      <P>Such evaluation has the advantage of focusing the group's attention on 
      accomplishments. Changes in the group's goals, committee organization, or 
      how meetings are conducted can be made now rather than put off until next 
      year.</P><U>
      <P>One-on-One Consultation</P></U>
      <P>One of the most useful forms of evaluation is face-to-face 
      consultation. Good managers are in frequent contact with workers (group 
      members). They seek feedback and advice. Most people are reluctant to give 
      advice unless it is asked for. To get useful feedback, <U>ask specific 
      questions</U>.</P>
      <P>Quickly get any areas of potential awkwardness out in the open, i.e., 
      "I heard you were upset with me about. . .Let's talk about that first." Be 
      an active listener. Don't respond defensively.</P>
      <P>In giving feedback that has not been requested, one-on-one 
      communication also works best. No one likes to be criticized in public. 
      (Review module V-6, for guidelines in giving constructive 
      criticism.)</P><U>
      <P>Written Evaluation Survey</P></U>
      <P>The traditional evaluation form asks participants to rate the meeting 
      (workshop or event) according to certain listed criteria. Several open 
      ended questions should also be included for a more detailed and personal 
      response, e.g., "Where might improvements be made?" Two examples of survey 
      evaluations forms are attached ("End of Meeting Suggestion Slip" and 
      "Workshop Evaluation," pages 10-11). Such surveys have the advantage of 
      being anonymous. Also, the results lend themselves to statistical 
      analysis. Take care in preparing the evaluation form to insure that the 
      questions asked are easily understood and that they provide information 
      that can be used.</P><B>
