      <H2>Principles of Adult Education E-2</H2><I>
      <P>An experienced person does the best work.</I></P>
      <P>Adult learners are normally considered to be those who have completed 
      their schooling (at least temporarily) and desire to learn something 
      outside the school system. Adult learners fit more into nonformal 
      education than formal education (see modules E-1 and E-3). While college 
      students are adults, they are part of the formal education system. 
      Traditionally, therefore, they are considered a part of formal education 
      rather than nonformal education.</P>
      <P>How do adults learn? What does this mean for educators? Below is a list 
      of principles of adult education. After each principle the implications 
      for the learners and for the educators are noted.</P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</STRONG></P>
      <P>By the end of this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe adult learners in terms of learning style 
      preferences.<BR>2. Tell how adult learners are similar and different than 
      students in school classrooms.</P>
      <P align=center><STRONG>EIGHT PRINCIPLES</STRONG></P><U>
      <P>1. The teaching/learning process is dynamic, interactive, and 
      cooperative.</U> A two-way interaction between learner and educator is 
      necessary. The educator does not simply "fill up" the passive learner with 
      "education." Both the learner and the educator must accept responsibility 
      for the learning. The learner must participate actively and willingly. The 
      educator must also be a learner. Sometimes the learner, due to previous 
      experience, teaches the educator. The adult educator is responsible for 
      teaching the learner how to learn. Sometimes this is more important that 
      what to learn. The learner has a right to know what is expected by the 
      educator who must make this very clear to the learner. In addition to 
      using strong skills in verbal communication, the educator must be an 
      effective listener. The educator must provide facts and resources that are 
      relevant to the learner. The learner must relate these facts and resources 
      to previous experience in such a way that meaningful learning occurs.</P>
      <P><U>2. Persons are more important than the subject being taught or 
      the</U> <U>teaching/learning technique being used</U>. Factual information 
      is useless unless it is of value to the learner. When the learner decides 
      to accept the learning that means a lifestyle change. The key to learning 
      is what happens to the learner. This means that the educator must know the 
      learner. Likewise the learner just open up to the educator and help that 
      educator to know the learner. The educator must strive to make the 
      learning relevant to the learner. The learner must accept equal 
      responsibility with the teacher in making the learning relevant. The 
      educator must be patient. The pace of the teaching depends on the pace of 
      the learner. The learner must make an effort to learn; must try to stay 
      with the educator and must signal the educator when the pace is too fast 
      or too slow. The educator must begin where the learner is ready to begin 
      and must strive to create maturity in the learner. Maturity is the ability 
      and willingness to take responsibility for the learning. The learner must 
      accept the need to mature. Both educator and learner must be flexible for 
      this relationship to be effective.</P><U>
      <P>3. Responsibility for teaching and learning is shared by both the 
      educator</U> <U>and the</U> learner. Both the educator and learner must 
      b-e cooperative and helpful. Although learning is an individual decision 
      by the learner to change his/her lifestyle, learning often occurs in 
      social settings where others can assist in the learning. The educator 
      never does anything for the learner that the learner can do. The learner 
      does not depend on the educator unless absolutely necessary. The educator 
      must be sensitive to learner readiness. Some motivation may be necessary. 
      The learner accepts some of the responsibility for readiness and 
      self-motivation. The learner must make decisions about the learning and 
      not leave these decisions to others. The educator must assist the learner 
      in making decisions and avoid making decisions for the learner. The 
      educator must not ask the learner to do anything that s/he, the educator, 
      would not do.</P><U>
      <P>4. The procedures used for teaching/learning must be determined by the 
      learner's goals.</U> The educator must involve the learner in setting 
      goals for the learning. Then the educator must help make to learner aware 
      of learning resources to meet those goals. The learner must learn how to 
      select resources and take responsibility to use those resources to meet 
      the goals that have been set.</P><U>
      <P>5. Ideally learning involves not just information but also skills and 
      attitudes</U>. Learning implies change. Sometimes change means recognizing 
      attitudes that inhibit learning. The educator must help the learner to 
      identify attitudes that need to be changed. The learner must recognize 
      that changes of attitudes can be beneficial. Both must move from the 
      cognitive (informational) aspects of learning to emphasize skills and 
      attitudes. They must identify skills and attitudes that are important and 
      work together to learn these. All information should be judged by the 
      criteria, "what will the learner do with this information that has been 
      learned... what difference will it make to the learner's 
lifestyle?"</P><U>
      <P>6. Both learners and educators must be willing to progress from a 
      supportive climate to a climate of direct challenge</U>. Both educators 
      and learners must recognize that the adult learner has had many 
      experiences which have formed a body of knowledge, strong feelings, 
      prejudices, and probably some misconceptions. Both must create an open 
      supportive environment where the learners accept themselves and understand 
      why they behave as they do. Then they must challenge those experiences and 
      beliefs to move beyond those that no longer serve ones lifestyle. This 
      process must be gradual with great sensitivity on both sides. An abrupt 
      challenge to an insecure adult may end the learning process and even ruin 
      the relationship. The educator must try to never put the learner on the 
      defensive. The learner must recognize when s/he is defensive. Both must 
      interact openly, in good faith, and creatively resolve any conflict which 
      arises. Both learner and educator must view the educator as a guide. At 
      times the learner may reject the guidance and this position may be 
      positive. The educator must be sensitive to the learner's needs and 
      readiness to accept guidance. Both must build strong rapport based on 
      honesty and empathy. Then both must be open to challenge, by the other 
      person, in order to consider new ideas, new options, and new 
      relationships.</P><U>
      <P>7. Evaluation should take place continuously in the teaching/learning 
      process.</U> An evaluative climate in which both the educator and the 
      learner are receptive to new perspectives on themselves and willing to 
      evaluate themselves, is important. The learner needs feedback from the 
      educator in order to make progress. Both need to evaluate the learning 
      climate as well as learning outcomes. Both must be flexible and 
      cooperative in making adjustments to the learning climate whether it deals 
      with information, skills, attitudes, or a combination of these three 
      aspects.</P><U>
      <P>8. Learning takes place when learners interact positively with each 
      other</U>. When learners create a positive learning climate in a group of 
      learners, progress can be more rapid and more significant. Trust, 
      security, and mutual confidence must exist to support learning in groups. 
      Competitive aspects of learning (getting the highest grade) should be 
      eliminated. The same relationships between educator and learner, discussed 
      above, must be developed among the learners in the learning group.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. How is an adult learner different from a student in primary school? 
      From a student in high school? From a university student?</P>
      <P>2. How are they similar (in each case)?</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Look (again) at a community group that you wish to teach. If possible 
      use a group of adults. Write down a list of guidelines to help you use 
      principles of adult education with this group. For example, "I will take 
      more time at the beginning to get to know each member of the group that I 
      am teaching." Share your list of guidelines with a partner or with the 
      members of your learning group to get their response. Discuss how you are 
      going to put these guidelines into practice. Incorporate your guidelines 
      into your lesson plan (if you are not familiar with lesson plans, look a 
      modules C-8 on using teaching/learning techniques or module LT-1 on 
      organizing workshops.)
