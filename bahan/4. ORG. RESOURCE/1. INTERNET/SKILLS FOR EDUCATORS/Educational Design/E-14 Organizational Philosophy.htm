      <H2 align=justify>Organizational Philosophy E-14</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>Whoever doesn't look ahead will always be behind.</I></P>
      <P>Before you develop a "statement of philosophy" for your group or 
      organization, you need to review module E-13 on developing a mission 
      statement. A mission statement tells your purpose and general goals.</P>
      <P>An organizational philosophy describes how you operate, what you offer 
      and how you are organized to meet your goals.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVE</B></P>
      <P>This module will help you to revise or develop a statement of 
      philosophy for your organization.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSIONS</B></P>
      <P>1. Does your organization have a mission statement?</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If the answer is yes, is it up to date...does it still describe your 
        organization to its stakeholders (groups of individuals who are affected 
        by the organization's success or failure)?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If the answer is no, does it need a mission statement?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>2. Who are your stakeholders? What are their concerns? What do you wish 
      them to know about your organization?</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Review the mission statements of some organizations that you know. 
      Include the example below. Review the exercise for developing a mission 
      statement (module E-13) and adapt that process to your group to develop 
      (or revise) your organizational philosophy.</P><B>
      <P align=center>AN EXAMPLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL PHILOSOPHY</B></P>
      <P>Pennsylvania 4-H has printed their philosophy statement on a four-fold, 
      multi-color flyer. On the front panel is a large 4-H clover. Then the 
      statement, "Take a look at us now!" At the bottom is the full 
      identification of the organization, "Youth develop programs, Cooperative 
      Extension Service, The Pennsylvania State University. </P>
      <P>Inside the flyer are four panels devoted to a short explanation of the 
      four H's. Another panel lists the projects offered through 4-H and a 
      paragraph which touches on important philosophical elements (youth learn 
      by doing; they prepare themselves for the future; they learn in groups of 
      youth; they have fun; they meet in their local community; they are taught 
      by professional agents and adult volunteers; they participate in fairs, 
      trips, tours, and camps; they host international youth visitors; they can 
      choose the projects for which they have an interest).</P>
      <P>Three panels of the flyer give short answers to the following 
      questions: how does one become a member of 4-H; how much does it cost; if 
      we live in the city can our youngster join; what ages are included; what 
      activities will my youngster do in the local club; am I required to be a 
      leader; can I be a leader if I have no children; do I need to be an expert 
      to lead a project; will my youngster be safe at all times; who sponsors 
      this program? The last panel is a list of the county offices and their 
      phone numbers so parents can contact their local 4-H agent.</P><B>
      <P align=center>NEXT STEPS</B></P>
      <P>When you have a philosophy statement that is supported by your 
      organization you will need to print it and be sure that every member of 
      the organization has a copy. You may want to have it printed in an 
      attractive format (such as a multi-color flyer) to be used for publicity 
      and recruitment.</P>
      <P>An organizational philosophy, along with the mission statement, are 
      valuable tools to use during the program planning process (see module </P>
      <P>E-4). Use them during the priority setting part of program planning 
      (see module E-6) when you are deciding on which needs of your members (or 
      clients) your organization should address in the coming year.</FONT> <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
