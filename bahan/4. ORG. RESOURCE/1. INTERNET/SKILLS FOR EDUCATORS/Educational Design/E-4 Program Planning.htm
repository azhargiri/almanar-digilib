      <H2 align=justify>Program Planning E-4</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>By trying to do too many things, you end up with nothing 
      done very well.</I></P>
      <P>Program planning is a process which takes you from ideas to action and 
      then to an evaluation which tells you if (or how well) you were able to 
      accomplish your ideas. In "moving from ideas to action,"<B> </B>you first 
      need ideas, then you must put them into action. Module E-5 shows you how 
      to identify the educational needs of a group, organization or community. 
      This module will help you generate ideas. Module E-6 will show you how to 
      determine priorities from the ideas. Module E-7 will give you practice in 
      writing objectives. Module E-8 will give you specific techniques for 
      assessing resources to tell you if your objectives are realistic. Module 
      E-9 then shows you how to put all of the work of these other modules into 
      a written plan. Module M-2 describes how to implement a written plan and 
      module E-10 describes how the plan can be evaluated. To become competent 
      in program planning you will need to complete each of these modules.</P>
      <P>This module will briefly review the steps in program planning. It will 
      show the relationship of the seven steps and the importance of each step 
      to the program planning process. </P><B>
      <P align=center>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After studying this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Explain the essential steps in "moving from ideas to action."<BR>2. 
      Describe how each of the seven steps is related to each other.</P><B>
      <P align=center>MOVING FROM IDEAS TO ACTION</B></P>
      <P>Why are some groups able to<B> </B>plan and complete one project after 
      another? Why do others seem<B> </B>to get little accomplished except 
      complaining and bickering? Why are outsiders sometimes able to quickly 
      help a community identify problems and plan solutions which have perplexed 
      local people for years?</P>
      <P>Part of the answer to each of these questions is in knowing how to 
      organize and what steps to follow. The process outlined below is one way 
      to guide leaders and workers through the essential steps to project 
      accomplishment.</P>
      <P>Basically, this process is like any planning process with one key 
      difference. This process cannot work without complete collaboration on the 
      part of all people involved. Assumptions about the community and decisions 
      for it must be made openly by community members. Leading a group through 
      this process means guiding, not controlling, so that ownership of the 
      project stays where it belongs--with the people, not just with the 
      "leaders."</P><U>
      <P>Identify Issues</U> - <U>Step I</U></P>
      <P>Find out what is on people's minds--their concerns, needs and wants. 
      Write these issues down, checking with the person who suggested each one 
      for clarification. Include as many people as possible in this step. Take 
      plenty of time to be certain that <U>everyone</U> has been encouraged to 
      express <U>all</U> concerns. Several sessions and more than one technique 
      may be needed to carry out this step.</P>
      <P>Techniques which may be used to identify the issues include 
      brainstorming, the nominal group process, a community survey and force 
      field analysis. These techniques must be used correctly to be 
      effective.</P><U>
      <P>Set Priorities</U> - <U>Step II</U></P>
      <P>Now separate needs from wants. People who are emotionally involved in 
      an issue may confuse their own "wants" with community "needs." Sort out 
      issues that are important to only one or two people. Focus on the really 
      important issues. Determine which is most important, second in importance, 
      third...etc. Then decide the correct sequence for attacking the top 
      priorities. In most cases, the nominal group process is the best technique 
      for setting priorities. Others which may be considered include an attitude 
      survey, group discussion and consensus building.</P>
      <P>Again, involve as many people as possible. At least be certain that all 
      viewpoints are represented in the group which is setting priorities.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<U>Set Goals and </U>Objectives - <U>Step III</U></P>
      <P>Determine what needs to be done about each priority and state that as a 
      goal. Then break the goal down into more specific objectives. Here is an 
      example of how this worked in one community organization:</P>
      <P>Issue - Tourist accommodations are inadequate.</P>
      <P>Goal - Provide more tourist accommodations.</P>
      <P>Objectives - </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>1. By June 1, a local sales team will be formed by the town.</P>
        <P>2. By December 31, a contract will be signed by the Town Council and 
        the motel chain specifying agreements to construct a 
      motel.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A goal is a general statement of intent. An objective tells <U>who</U> 
      will do <U>what</U> by <U>when</U>. Well-written objectives are 
      challenging, realistic, specific, measurable, simple, and not too 
      confining.</P><U>
      <P>Assess Resources</U> - <U>Step IV</U></P>
      <P>What human, financial, and physical resources are available to carry 
      out the objectives? If the resources are inadequate, for any reason, then 
      the objectives may need to be rewritten to make them more realistic.</P>
      <P>Techniques which may help assess resources include a local resource 
      inventory, public meeting, or discussions with individuals who are aware 
      of the area, state, and federal resources. Communities should overlook 
      neither local nor outside resources.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<U>Form a Plan</U> - <U>Step V</U> </P>
      <P>Once the available resources are in line with the objectives, a plan 
      should be written down. People involved will want to discuss alternative 
      strategies for meeting the objectives. The plan represents the best 
      alternative.</P>
      <P>The objectives as well as activities for meeting the objectives should 
      be included in the plan. The plan should specify individuals' 
      responsibilities and a time by which each activity will be completed. The 
      plan coordinates all of the resources so the overall goal is accomplished 
      logically and efficiently.</P>
      <P>In delegating responsibilities, keep in mind that some people are 
      willing to help plan, some will legitimize, some will provide resources, 
      and some will be workers. If planners are called on to be workers, they 
      may rebel and fail to deliver. Using people in the wrong roles is a common 
      mistake. Be sure people are committed to do specifically what the plan 
      requires of them.</P><U>
      <P>Implement the Plan</U> - <U>Step VI</U></P>
      <P>Constantly refer to the written plan to guide the<B> </B>work. 
      Techniques needed at this point include effective communication, conflict 
      resolution, group dynamics, and publicity. If the plan has been carefully 
      written, individuals who have the necessary skills will have the 
      responsibility to use those skills at the right time.</P>
      <P>In some communities, people lack some of the critical skills or at 
      least the confidence to use them. In that case, the community should 
      organize training to<B> </B>develop necessary skills before plunging 
      ahead.</P>
      <P><U>Evaluate Results</U> - <U>Step VII</U></P>
      <P>Encourage feedback from everyone who is involved. As people implement 
      the plan, they will invariably run into snags. Everything cannot be 
      anticipated in the plan. At this point, it may be desirable to adjust the 
      plan to make it more realistic before proceeding. Maintain an attitude of 
      flexibility which will enable minor adjustments or, if necessary, a major 
      adjustment where the entire plan must be rewritten due to a major 
snag.</P>
      <P>When you think the project is completed, check the objectives to be 
      certain nothing has been overlooked. You may want an outsider to conduct a 
      formal evaluation in some cases. You will at least want to record what you 
      did, right or wrong, to improve chances of success on future 
      projects.</P><U>
      <P>Other Considerations</U></P>
      <P>The process described above is sequential. Step three cannot be 
      accomplished until steps one and two have been done. However, once you get 
      into step three, it may change your thinking on steps one and two. When 
      you backtrack to make changes, follow the effects of those changes through 
      each succeeding step. </P>
      <P>In any educational program, readiness is an issue. The best plan will 
      have little chance of success if people aren't ready for it. Finally, use 
      consultants if they are available. Don't get into the rut of trying to do 
      too much by yourself. Ask for help and use it.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. What happens if you skip one of the steps? How will that omission 
      affect the process? ...the success of your group in accomplishing its 
      ideas?</P>
      <P>2. Which of these steps is most commonly ignored by the groups, 
      organizations or communities in which you work? Why?</P>
      <P>3. What personal actions can you take to help these groups to be more 
      productive, more interesting to its members, and more useful to the larger 
      community of which it is a part?</FONT> <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
