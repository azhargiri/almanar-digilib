      <H2 align=justify>Mission Statement E-13</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>If you don't know where you're going, you're bound to end 
      up someplace else. </I></P>
      <P align=justify>(attributed to Casey Stengel, former baseball 
manager)</P>
      <P align=justify>Many groups lack a clear sense of direction. Each member 
      has different ideas as to what the group should accomplish. These 
      individual perceptions often differ, leading to misunderstanding and 
      conflict. In this module you will learn to involve group members in a 
      process which will not only clarify group purpose but also inspire and 
      motivate membership. Then you can develop an organizational structure that 
      gets results.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>1. Write (or revise) a "mission statement."</P>
      <P>2. Develop a unified sense of direction for your group or organization 
      </P><B>
      <P align=center>WHAT IS YOUR MISSION?</B></P>
      <P>A group with a clear mission and a set of goals and objectives which 
      are mutually accepted by its membership has an achieving force that is 
      almost irresistible. People are motivated through ideas, programs and 
      results--not merely by being members. A clear statement of the mission and 
      goals of a group provides the basis on which people can judge the merits 
      of that group relative to their own needs and interests.</P>
      <P>Group identity doesn't just happen. It is developed. New members may 
      identify with an organization merely because they have joined. That 
      reason, however, will last only for a few weeks or months. New members' 
      initial enthusiasm will quickly dissipate if the organization fails to 
      address their individual concerns. The same thing can happen to older 
      members.</P><B>
      <P align=center>CLARIFYING YOUR MISSION</B></P>
      <P>A mission is a general statement of a group's ideals and purpose. A 
      mission statement tells what the group represents and what general issues 
      it addresses. A mission statement explains the group to outsiders as well 
      as providing focus for its members. Many groups are associated with a 
      state or national organization which has a formal statement of mission, 
      along with organizational guidelines. Such groups should periodically 
      review that mission and clarify its meaning. The local group should be 
      encouraged to expand on that mission statement, putting it into its own 
      words and, therefore, establishing its unique identity. It is important 
      that the mission statement be developed and internalized by group members, 
      rather than imposed upon them. Otherwise, there is limited ownership. A 
      group with no outside affiliation is in the fortunate position of being 
      able to develop its own mission, tailored to its unique situation and 
      needs.</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Set aside time at a regular or special meeting to develop/review your 
      mission statement. Call on each member in turn to express what s/he feels 
      should be the purpose and ideals of the organization. Record these on 
      newsprint or a chalkboard for all to see. Once everyone has been called 
      upon, review the list. Ask for comments. "Is this an ideal to which we all 
      wish to commit ourselves?" If there are objections, modify the statement 
      to meet the group's approval. Ask for suggestions as to how the wording of 
      the statements might be improved. After a period of discussion, form a 
      committee to combine and condense the listed statements into a mission 
      statement, to be presented at the next meeting. Time is taken at that 
      meeting to discuss and revise the condensed statement until consensus is 
      reached. This consensus building process may require several meetings, 
      with the committee incorporating suggestions into the statement for the 
      group's review.</P>
      <P>The more that individual members are directly involved in developing 
      and revising the mission statement the more meaning it will have to them. 
      Otherwise, the exercise becomes one of indoctrination with limited 
      motivational impact.</P><B>
      <P align=center>IF YOUR GROUP LACKS ENTHUSIASM, IT MOST LIKELY IS DUE TO 
      EITHER:</B></P>
      <P>1. The lack of a clear understanding among members as to what the 
      purpose and goals of the group are. In other words, you haven't done 
      enough planning or goal setting.....or</P>
      <P>2. The group's goals are not seen as personally important to many of 
      the members. In other words, the members weren't really involved in the 
      planning and goal setting.....or</P>
      <P>3. Members fail to see how many of the group's activities really 
      contribute to the agreed upon goals. In other words, your goals are not 
      being followed.</P>
      <P>You may wish to refer to other groups' mission statements as you write 
      or revise yours. Three examples are offered below.</P><B>
      <P align=center>MISSION STATEMENT EXAMPLES</B></P>
      <P align=center>Country Living Fair Mission Statement </P>
      <P>The overall mission of our organization is to provide awareness of 
      alternatives for decision-making on family self-sufficiency. We will focus 
      on information related to health and nutrition, energy, construction, food 
      production and preservation, cottage industries, and use of leisure time. 
      We encourage wide diversity of viewpoints and will not endorse any 
      particular viewpoint. We will remain independent from control of any 
      particular organization. We will operate on a non-profit basis. Our 
      principal activity will be an annual educational fair.</P>
      <P align=center>Arizona 4-H Mission Statement.</P>
      <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arizona 4-H Program is one of four educational 
      programs of the University of Arizona Cooperative Extension Service. This 
      program involving youth and adults is:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) nonformal and out-of-school</P>
        <P>b) county oriented and locally determined</P>
        <P>c) primarily group focused and family oriented</P>
        <P>d) volunteer staffed and supervised by professional salaried 
        faculty.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>2. 4-H employs planned "learn by doing" experiences to enable youth to 
      develop essential life skills, i.e.:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) be socially, physically, and mentally healthy</P>
        <P>b) explore and evaluate job, career and leisure time 
opportunities</P>
        <P>c) acquire subject matter skills and knowledge reflecting current and 
        new technologies</P>
        <P>d) learn and practice leadership skills and fulfill leadership 
        roles</P>
        <P>e) participate in community and public affairs</P>
        <P>f) understand and appreciate cultural similarities and 
        differences.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>3. 4-H is staffed by youth and adult volunteers under the supervision 
      of professional salaried faculty:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>a) The volunteers may do one or more of the following: teach, 
        recruit, train, organize, provide support service, advise, counsel.</P>
        <P>b) The professional salaried faculty uphold the principles of 4-H and 
        the use of its emblem. They plan, recruit, supervise, enable and 
        evaluate. They teach volunteers to use subject matter, educational 
        methods, and the democratic process to achieve program 
      objectives.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>4. 4-H is publicly supported by county, state and federal governments. 
      Private resources, both human and material, are used to enrich the 
      learning experience of youth and adults.</P>
