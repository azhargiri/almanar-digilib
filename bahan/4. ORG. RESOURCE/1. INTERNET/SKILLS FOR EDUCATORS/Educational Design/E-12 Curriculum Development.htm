      <H2 align=justify>Curriculum Development E-12</H2>
      <P>Curriculum is usually understood as an organized program of educational 
      offerings. Ornstein &amp; Hunkins (1988) define curriculum as "a plan for 
      action, or a written document, which includes strategies for achieving 
      desired goals or ends."</P>
      <P>Before attempting this module you may wish to review the discussion of 
      nonformal education in modules E-1 and E-3.</P><B>
      <P align=center>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>By studying this module you should </P>
      <P>1. Understand how curricula are developed for Pennsylvania 4-H.</P>
      <P>2. Develop a plan for curriculum development for a particular audience 
      in nonformal education.</P><B>
      <P align=center>CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOR PENNSYLVANIA 4-H</P></B>
      <P>In Pennsylvania curriculum development for the 4-H youth development 
      program is the process whereby curriculum is planned and organized to meet 
      4-H program objectives. A 4-H curriculum includes written materials 
      (project guides, leaders guides, supplementary bulletins, etc.) as well as 
      the activities (meetings, workshops, competitions, community service, 
      etc.) needed to meet specific project objectives as well as the 4-H 
      program objectives (including positive impact on youth and society). 
      Attached is a diagram which depicts this curriculum development process. 
      This diagram describes how curriculum has been successfully developed in 
      the past as well as how it should be developed in the future. There is 
      nothing strikingly new or innovative about this diagram but it does 
      include all of the steps in a written sequence.</P>
      <P>This diagram describes a model which can be used in at least three 
      different settings: 1) for a committee composed of state 4-H specialists, 
      state subject matter specialists, county 4-H agents, and volunteers, to 
      plan and write a new curriculum at the state level; 2) for a committee 
      representing county 4-H agents and project leaders to plan and write a new 
      curriculum for a special need at the county level; and 3) for any 4-H 
      professional to adapt and rewrite a curriculum based on a project in 
      another state.</P>
      <P>The process starts with needs assessment. County agents may call on 
      colleagues who have successfully completed a county needs assessment as 
      well as state specialists for help in planning their respective county 
      needs assessments.</P>
      <P>Based on the needs of 4-H clients, the curriculum developer must choose 
      the program area where the developed curriculum would fit. Those areas 
      include: animal science, plant science, mechanical science, natural 
      resources, careers, citizenship, leisure and cultural education, family 
      living, communications, leadership and "other." Specialists will need to 
      be contacted and written materials reviewed to determine what exists (or 
      what existed before) that is related to the proposed curriculum. The key 
      questions at this point are "where will this new curriculum fit" and "how 
      will the organization support it?"</P>
      <P>Next, specific project materials and supporting activities are 
      reviewed. Gaps, problems and opportunities must be identified if the new 
      curriculum is to be relevant, complete, and not in conflict with existing 
      curricula. Resources (people, time, money, materials) needed for proposed 
      activities should also be considered. Sources of information for writing 
      the new curriculum should be thoroughly reviewed. Information should be 
      organized in outline form according to an approved format to insure 
      consistency and completeness. This format will vary according to the 
      delivery system. Activities needed to support the information should be 
      outlined. Each activity will have its own agenda (schedule of events).</P>
      <P>Now the outlines can be "fleshed out" with attention given to the 
      reading level of the intended audience and to the ten life skill areas. 
      Written materials should be reviewed and edited by someone different than 
      the author. The agenda for each activity should be developed in detail, 
      then criticized and refined. At this point the activities and written 
      materials can be piloted with a small target audience. If necessary, 
      materials and activities can be revised after the pilots to eliminate 
      problems in implementation.</P>
      <P>The written materials are than disseminated and supporting activities 
      implemented. Formative evaluation in the early stages of implementation 
      will be critical. Following the initial stages, periodic evaluation may be 
      formative or summative as decisions are made to continue, revise, or 
      abandon the curriculum. Major revision of the curriculum may be desirable 
      at some point. Then the entire curriculum development process can be 
      initiated again beginning with needs assessment. Part of that needs 
      assessment would be the summative evaluation of the old curriculum.</P><B>
      <P align=center>SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS</B></P>
      <P>Pennsylvania 4-H uses three supporting documents in curriculum 
      development. These are the state 4-H objectives, a list of life skills of 
      youth identified through research by 4-H specialists, and a two-page 
      summary of curriculum design elements important to 4-H curriculum.</P>
      <P>These design elements include:</P>
      <P>1. action -- make certain youth are not treated as passive learners, 
      build in fun, build on their interests, let them see that they are making 
      progress;</P>
      <P>2. interaction -- provide ample opportunities for youth to interact 
      with people, ideas and things;</P>
      <P>3. decision making -- teach and use the decision making process 
      increasing youth's experience in making decisions; </P>
      <P>4. recognition -- reinforce learning by a wide variety of informal as 
      well as formal types of recognition for accomplishment, participation and 
      teamwork;</P>
      <P>5. public affirmation -- provide opportunities for youth to publicly 
      share what they have learned by speaking, exhibiting, performing, etc.</P>
      <P>6. leadership (helpership) -- provide a variety of opportunities for 
      youth to help teach others by giving them responsibility, guidance and 
      support;</P>
      <P>7. flexibility -- provide a variety of learning opportunities on 
      various topics in different settings with a minimum of unnecessary 
      rigidity which restricts participation;</P>
      <P>8. utilization of resources -- help youth to recognize and use such 
      resources as themselves, other people, things, family activities, 
      etc.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. Does your organization provide education for clients or members?</P>
      <P>2. Is it formal or nonformal education?</P>
      <P>3. What is the curriculum (written materials <B>AND</B> 
activities)?</P>
      <P>4. Where is the curriculum weakest?</P>
      <P>5. What new curriculum do you need? Can you get it elsewhere or should 
      you develop it internally? Who should be involved?</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Find a piece of written curriculum that your group uses for educational 
      purposes. Follow the curriculum development process described above to 
      revise and strengthen the curriculum. Review your organization's mission, 
      goals and objectives at the beginning of your revisions. Ask yourself if 
      there are specific curriculum design elements that should be 
      included.</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Plan a new curriculum piece to meet educational needs that are unmet so 
      far. You may do this for your own organization or work with 
      representatives of another organization who need a new curriculum for an 
      emerging educational need. Start by reviewing this module. Then outline a 
      plan for involving other key people in the process. Write a least a page 
      outline that tells <U>who does what by when</U> in order to produce a 
      draft of the new curriculum with its written materials and supporting 
      activities. Share your draft with a colleague for critique and 
      feedback.</FONT>
