      <H2 align=justify>Setting Priorities E-6</H2>
      <P align=justify><I>People are more willing to do the legwork if they are 
      also involved in the planning.</I></P>
      <P>Before beginning this module you should review the program planning 
      process (module E-4) and complete module E-5 (needs assessment).</P>
      <P>Now that you have identified the needs of the group with which you are 
      working, you have a list of ideas (needs). You cannot hope to attack all 
      of the needs at once. You need to set priorities. Don't try to do this 
      alone. Involve a representative group of people (including representatives 
      of those individuals who are most knowledgeable about the group's needs 
      and those who are most affected).</P>
      <P>Generally, people are more willing to do the legwork if they have had a 
      say in the planning. Rarely do people get as excited about someone else's 
      idea as they do about their own. Taking time annually at the start of the 
      program year to convert individual needs and concerns into group 
      priorities (goals) not only provides needed direction for the organization 
      but also can be a motivational experience.</P>
      <P align=center>&nbsp;<B>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</B></P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able</P>
      <P>1. To describe the "nominal group process."<BR>2. To lead a priority 
      setting session using the nominal group process.</P><B>
      <P align=center>A GOAL SETTING PROCESS</B></P>
      <P>There is no single best way to set goals. Goal setting can be as simple 
      or as involved as you wish to make it. A simple process is described 
      below. This process should help you tailor a goal setting exercise to the 
      circumstances and needs of your group.</P>
      <P>This process is patterned after a goal setting technique called 
      "nominal group process" developed by A.H. Van de Ven and A.L. Delbecq of 
      the University of Wisconsin, Madison. It provides a structured process 
      which allows people to express their individual priorities, and then 
      converts them to group priorities. If those present will agree to follow a 
      few simple yet firm rules, the process can be extremely effective--even 
      when disagreement and controversy are present. The process maximizes the 
      creativity and input of each participant, and produces more and higher 
      quality suggestions than ordinary group discussion. It also prohibits any 
      single speaker or topic from dominating the meeting.</P><U>
      <P>Set the Stage</U>. Take time to explain goal setting, and its value, to 
      the group. Set a date and time for your goal setting session, preferably 
      of two hours duration. Ask members to prepare for the meeting by 
      clarifying in their own minds what they would like to see the group 
      accomplish during the coming year. The setting of group goals is difficult 
      until the individuals involved have first set personal goals. Ask members 
      to take time to clarify for themselves what is important to them and how 
      they want to spend their time, within and outside this group.</P><U>
      <P>Prepare</U>: Arrange for a comfortable room, large enough to hold the 
      expected number of participants in such a manner that tables seating 5-8 
      persons can be placed adequately apart for independent group activity. 
      Arrange to have one Group Leader/Recorder at each table, and an overall 
      coordinator for the meeting. The following supplies are also needed for 
      each table: six to eight large sheets of newsprint(*), four or five 5 x 8 
      index cards per person, a broad felt tip marking pen, masking tape, 
      pencils and an easel with a back (handy, but not essential). (* Sheets of 
      newsprint, approximately 28" x 32", can be acquired from your local 
      newspaper or office supply store. Butcher paper or the paper used to cover 
      tables can also be easily cut into the size of sheets needed. A blackboard 
      could also be used.)</P>
      <P>At the start of your goal setting session, clarify the task, the 
      specific question(s) to be discussed. Write out this task on newsprint or 
      a blackboard for all to see. For example, "What are the two or three 
      things you would most like to see the group accomplish during the coming 
      year?" or "What would you like to see the Chamber of Commerce do toward 
      expanding tourism?" or "What should be emphasized in the 4-H program 
      during the coming year?" or "What are the principle concerns of the 
      farmers in the county?" The wording of the problem, question, or task is 
      crucial in obtaining the focused response desired of participants. Before 
      the meeting, the organizers should determine precisely the wording of this 
      task. Make it simple, clear and straightforward.</P>
      <P>If the group is larger than ten, break into small groups of five to 
      eight. Ask each small group to go through this exercise independently, and 
      then share its small group recommendations with the larger group at the 
      end of the session.</P><U>
      <P>Individual Writing Exercise:</U> Pass out index cards or sheets of 
      paper. Have each person jot down suggestions in response to the question 
      (task) before the group. Individuals are to work alone and in silence. 
      This individual writing exercise gets each person's concerns and desires 
      down on paper, and thus ensures input from everyone. It helps people 
      clarify in their own minds what is important to them. It is much easier 
      for people to write something down and then read it than it is for them to 
      speak spontaneously. Ask participants to limit their suggestions to what 
      they wish to commit themselves to accomplish during the coming <U>12 
      months</U>. Break large goals into specific activities that can be 
      completed this year.</P>
      <P>After everyone has completed the writing exercise, you may want them to 
      go back and rank the items each has listed, in order of personal 
      preference. Place a "1" by your first priority/biggest concern, a "2" by 
      your second, etc.</P><U>
      <P>Round Robin Sharing:</U> Have everyone in turn read what s/he has 
      written. Prohibit group discussion during this period, except for 
      questions of clarification. The purpose of this segment is to share, to 
      listen and to understand and appreciate the opinions of others. The pros 
      and cons of each will be discussed later. The round robin insures input 
      from everyone, encourages people to speak up without fear of being 
      criticized or put down by others in the group, and it keeps individuals 
      from dominating the discussion.</P>
      <P>As it is shared, list each suggestion on newsprint or a black-board. 
      When you fill a sheet, tape it to a wall for all to see. The Recorder 
      should take care to list each idea as stated and not try to categorize or 
      restate the individual suggestions. The process of listing gives the 
      participant immediate recognition, guards against miscommunication, and 
      serves as an official record of the meeting. Each idea should be numbered, 
      in sequence, for later reference.</P>
      <P>Have each person in turn read the #l suggestion <U>only</U>. If their 
      first suggestion has already been mentioned by another participant, they 
      should read their second suggestion. Then go around the room again for 
      every- one's #2 suggestion, etc. This facilitates priority setting. 
      Continue the round robin until <U>all</U> ideas have been 
expressed.</P><U>
      <P>Set Priorities:</U> After each person has shared suggestions for the 
      goals and objectives of the group, the session is now, and only now, 
      opened to group discussion. Participants can now clarify, lobby for or 
      defend the listed statements. Set a time limit, preferably 15-20 minutes. 
      Keep the groups aware of how much time is left. </P>
      <P>After the period of discussion ends, everyone votes. On a clean index 
      card, have each person write FIRST VOTE in the upper right hand corner. 
      Then, using the numbers assigned to the statements in the preceding step, 
      everyone ranks t<U>he top three items</U> listed on the large sheets. 
      Individuals must work in silence. </P>
      <P>Scores should be tallied by the Group Leader. (This is a good time for 
      a 5-10 minute BREAK.) Give a score of three to each individual's top 
      priority item, two to each second priority, and one point for each third 
      place vote. Record these scores on the master list. Highest overall score 
      is considered the item of highest priority, the second highest score is 
      second priority, etc.</P>
      <P>Call for reports from each of the small groups. Identify commonalties, 
      and star (*) those statements that have the greatest support among all 
      group members. Review each of the starred (*) statements. Ask, "Is it the 
      consensus of the group then that this should be one of the priorities we 
      focus on during the coming year? Is there anyone who is not comfortable 
      with this priority?" If there are objections, modify the statement to meet 
      the group's approval.</P>
      <P>If there is not an obvious consensus, you might wish to undertake a 
      second voting after a period of debate. The second voting is just like the 
      first except that each participant votes for his/her top three ideas from 
      all of the lists on the wall (the lists from all of the small groups).</P>
      <P>Program planning is meaningless unless priorities are set. By setting 
      priorities, a group concentrates its limited time and resources on those 
      actions which are most important to it. Very few organizations are able to 
      focus on more than two or three priority items at once.</P><B>
      <P align=center>AFTER THE PROCESS</B></P><U>
      <P>Put in Writing and Distribute Widely</U>: Assign to someone the task of 
      writing the formal goals statement. Such writing is best not done by 
      committee. Assign each of the top priorities (2-5 of the highest 
      priorities) to someone to turn the priority into a general goal. This goal 
      will tell <U>who</U> does <U>what</U> (action or activity) by <U>when</U> 
      (date or deadline) but not in any great detail. After the goals statement 
      has been prepared, it should be discussed and approved at a regular 
      meeting. Then you are ready to turn the general goals into specific 
      objectives (see module E-7). Once your goals and objectives have been 
      formally adopted by the group, make sure all members are provided with a 
      copy. Mail a copy to all possible supporters, e.g., city council, local 
      newspaper, and state agencies. Formally review your goals and objectives 
      at least quarterly.</P><U>
      <P>Update Annually</U>: If group opinion changes, modify your goals to 
      reflect it. When a group's objectives fail to keep up with the changing 
      needs and interests of its members, they drop out or become spiritless and 
      apathetic.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, priority setting can be an invigorating exercise, if 
      done properly. When people have the chance to share ideas and to be 
      directly involved in setting priorities for the group, they assume greater 
      ownership of the goals set, and are generally more committed to carrying 
      them out. When goals are set for the group by its officers or board of 
      directors, the level of commitment is not the same. Often we try to speed 
      up the goal setting process. Only the most vocal members have their say, 
      and the remaining members feel railroaded. They then sit back and let the 
      officers do the work.</P>
      <P>The above process can be easily modified to fit the constraints and 
      desires of the group. If time is limited, the round robin exercise alone 
      can be very productive. If you short-change the process, however, benefits 
      will be lost. The biggest mistake groups commonly make is to do goal 
      setting in one large group. In groups larger than ten, it is physically 
      impossible for everyone to make input and to be directly involved in the 
      discussion (within reasonable time constraints). Most of the motivational 
      dynamics is lost with groups larger than ten. Instead, break into small 
      groups of five to eight to complete the exercise.&nbsp;</P><B>
      <P align=center>FACILITATING THE GOALS PROCESS</B></P>
      <P>Goal setting will be a motivating experience only if someone takes the 
      responsibility to make it so. A facilitator should be selected to guide 
      the goal setting process. The facilitator strives to enhance the dynamics 
      of the exercise. The facilitator remains neutral, controls the process but 
      does not participate in or try to influence the content of what is 
      decided. The facilitator's tasks include:</P><U>
      <P>Set the stage</U>. Introduce the concept of goal setting and describe 
      its potential value to the group. Help the group design a goal setting 
      exercise tailored to its particular needs, circumstances and time. Insure 
      that the questions (tasks) to be addressed in the goal setting exercise 
      are clear.</P><U>
      <P>Orient participants</U> as to what to expect in the goals meeting. Urge 
      participants to prepare, to have clear in their own minds what they would 
      like to see the group accomplish.</P>
      <P>At the start of the goals session, explain how the session will be 
      conducted. <U>Serve as a "traffic cop"</U> in ensuring that the prescribed 
      process is followed, that everyone has an equal opportunity to make input 
      with no one dominating, and that no one is put down or criticized for any 
      suggestions. (People often do not speak up for fear of being disagreed 
      with, criticized or made fun of by others in the group.)</P><U>
      <P>Strictly enforce the ground rules</U>, e.g., no discussion during the 
      round robin. Keep the discussion moving by calling on each person in turn. 
      "John, what do you suggest?" Encourage and give recognition: "Good idea." 
      Record all input on newsprint or blackboard for all to see.</P><U>
      <P>Prepare a written statement</U> of the priorities set, to be reviewed, 
      modified and adopted at the group's next meeting. Once adopted, distribute 
      copies to members and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>Below is an outline that you can follow when leading a nominal group 
      process (NGP).<B>&nbsp;</B></P><B>
      <P align=center>A FACILITATOR'S OUTLINE TO CONDUCT NGP</B></P><U>
      <P>Introduction</U> The purpose of this process is to identify needs of 
      <U>youth in Blizzard County</U> for the next 12 months. Nominal group 
      process is a tested and refined process that works. It is structured into 
      steps. Staying on time is important. Rules will be followed to ensure 
      opportunities for everyone's opinion. We will move from individual 
      opinions to group priorities. We need your serious effort, cooperation, 
      and trust. The statement we are addressing is: "By this time next year the 
      following needs of youth in our county should be met."</P>
      <P>This process will consist of seven steps which are .....(see 
      below).</P><U>
      <P>Step 1 - Individual Writing</U> (5-10 minutes)&nbsp; Write as many 
      brief (2-5 words) answers to the statement as you can. </P><U>
      <P>Step 2 - Small Groups List Individual's Answers on Newsprint</U> (10-20 
      minutes) Break into small groups of 5-12 individuals. Use a round 
      robin--each persons gives one response in turn. The discussion leader (or 
      a recorder picked by the leader) writes the response on the newsprint and 
      gives it a number. Keep going around the group until each person has all 
      ideas listed (no duplication). No discussion, elaboration, evaluation, or 
      comments are allowed. Move quickly. </P><U>
      <P>Step 3 - Small Group Debate</U> (15-20 minutes) The ideas on the 
      newsprint now belong to the group. You may now clarify, lobby, defend or 
      attack ideas (not people). Which ideas are most important for the group to 
      address this year? We will vote in 15 minutes so this is your chance to 
      convince others of what is important. Please be brief in your comments in 
      order to give everyone plenty of chances to speak. Do not repeat the 
      comments of others even if you strongly agree.</P><U>
      <P>Step 4 - Small Group Votes</U> (5 minutes) Time is up, we are now ready 
      to vote. (Handout a new index card of another color to each group member.) 
      Mark your card <U>1st-</U> then put the number of the idea from the 
      newsprint that you think is most important. Under 1st, write <U>2nd-</U> 
      followed by the number of the idea from the newsprint that you think is 
      second in importance. Then write <U>3rd-</U> and record your third place 
      vote. If you vote for more than three ideas your vote will not be 
      counted.</P><U>
      <P>Coffee Break While Votes Are Counted</U> (10 minutes)&nbsp; The small 
      group leader picks an assistant to read the votes and records them, in 
      pencil, on the newsprint beside the ideas receiving the votes. A first 
      place idea gets 3 points; a second place idea gets 2 points; and a third 
      place vote gets 1 point. Add the points for each idea. The idea with the 
      most points is the #1 priority. Number all of the priorities in order 
      until you have a top 10. Then quickly rewrite the top ten priorities, in 
      order of priority, on a clean sheet of newsprint.</P><U>
      <P>Step 5 - Reports And General Discussion</U> (15-30 minutes) Each small 
      group leader reads the top 10 priorities for the small group. Do not give 
      any additional explanation unless absolutely necessary for clarification. 
      The meeting facilitator then thanks the small group leaders and asks if 
      any of the ideas are duplicated by more than one group. Duplication is 
      eliminated by crossing off duplicate ideas. </P>
      <P>Now we will debate <U>all</U> of the ideas on the newsprint, just like 
      we did in the small groups, and vote again in 20 minutes. Please follow 
      the same debate rules that we used for the small groups.</P><U>
      <P>Step 6 - Vote And Tabulate</U> (10 minutes) (Hand out a new card of a 
      different color.) Vote for only your top three ideas from all of the ideas 
      now before the group.</P><U>
      <P>Step 7 - Announce Results And Wrapup</U> (10 minutes) Our top ten 
      priorities are the following..... How many do you think we can accomplish 
      in the next year? Who would like to volunteer to write the first priority 
      as a goal that tells what actions should be taken, by whom, by when, in 
      order to address the priority? Who would like to work on priority #2? 
      Priority #3? Enough? </P>
      <P>The goal statements will be presented at our next regular meeting for 
      discussion and approval. Thank you all for your cooperation. This has been 
      a very productive meeting thanks to you.</P><B>
      <P>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Work with a partner to plan and conduct a nominal group process. You 
      may want to use a group of volunteers to role play members of your 
      organization before you try the process in a live meeting.</P><B>
      <P align=center>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B></P>
      <P>1. Did the process work for you and your group? <BR>2. Were any 
      modifications necessary?<BR>3. Do you now feel confident to lead the 
      process with other groups?</FONT> <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
