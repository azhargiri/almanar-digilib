      <H2 align=justify>Writing a Plan E-9</H2><I>
      <P align=justify>A long journey consists of many short steps.</I></P>
      <P align=justify>Before you are ready to write a plan for your group, 
      organization or community, you must complete the other steps of the 
      program planning process (modules E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7 and E-8).</P><B>
      <P align=center>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE</B></P>
      <P>When you finish with this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Write a plan which will tell your group what needs to be done, by 
      whom, and by what date.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<B>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>You should now be ready to organize activities which meet each 
      objective written earlier (module E-7). Sometimes one activity will 
      fulfill several objectives. Other times, several activities will be needed 
      to accomplish one objective.</P>
      <P>Use the "planning worksheet" (next page) to begin a plan of work. Write 
      down the activities (events, actions) that are needed to complete the 
      objectives. If you need more pages, keep going.</P>
      <P>Discuss your plan with colleagues and refine it until it appears to be 
      complete, specific and pertinent to your objectives.</P>

      <P>How will this objective be evaluated? When? By whom?<B></P>
      <P align=center>COMPLETING THE PLAN OF WORK</B></P>
      <P>By now you realize, if you didn't already, that writing plans of work 
      is time-consuming. You can't do it in one sitting. To write a plan of work 
      for an organization, you must allow plenty of time and involve many 
      people. Go back to your group's priorities for the coming year (see module 
      E-6) and assign one priority to a committee. Ask each committee to restate 
      its priority as a goal then write from 1 to 3 objectives using the 
      "checklist to evaluate objectives." Then decide if you want the committee 
      to fill out a "planning worksheet" for its objectives. You may decide to 
      do the </P>
      <P>planning worksheet yourself or delegate the planning of all objectives 
      to yet another committee.</P>
      <P>Review each planning worksheet using the following criteria:</P>
      <P>1. Is it clear (impossible to misunderstand)?<BR>2. Are activities in a 
      logical sequence?<BR>3. Can the responsibilities assigned be done by the 
      individual assigned?<BR>4. Is the plan complete (no steps are left out - 
      nothing is assumed to happen without being written down)?<BR>5. Are the 
      time lines reasonable?</P><B>
      <P align=center>NEXT STEPS</B></P>
      <P>Bring the completed plan before the officers then the general 
      membership for their approval. Allow time for debate and be willing to 
      accept useful amendments. Then provide a copy of the final plan to each 
      member and to other groups or individuals who are affected by the 
plan.</P>
      <P>Refer to the written plan throughout the year to keep everyone working 
      on the same priorities. Some flexibility is necessary to take care of 
      problems and opportunities which arise after the plan is written. One 
      purpose of the plan is to keep individuals from forgetting about the 
      group's goals before they are accomplished. Without a written plan the 
      group is likely to chase the latest fad or idea-of-the-day until they are 
      exhausted and frustrated. Without a plan which reflects the desires and 
      interests of its members, a group may see its members lose interest and 
      drop out.</P>
      <P>Many organizations write a calendar of activities which is simply a 
      simplified outline of the activities in their plan of work (see module 
      E-11). See module M-2 to help you implement the plan you have written. 
      Remember to evaluate your plan of work (see module E-10) and use the 
      evaluation results to get started on next year's plan of work. </FONT><!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
