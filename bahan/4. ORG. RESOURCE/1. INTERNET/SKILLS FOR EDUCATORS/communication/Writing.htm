      <H2>Writing C-4</H2><I>
      <P align=center>If the newspapers can possibly screw up one of your 
      articles, you can be certain that they will. -Advice from the old county 
      agent.</I> </P>
      <P>The goal of journalism (writing for mass media) is not just to be 
      understood; our goal must be to write so that misunderstanding will be 
      impossible.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After completing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Write a news release for a local newspaper.<BR>2. Describe a process 
      for improving your writing skills.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>PREPARE A NEWS RELEASE</H3>
      <P>We will assume that everyone reading this module has some degree of 
      writing skills. Rather than try to address grammar, composition, sentence 
      structure, spelling, punctuation, rhetoric, style, etc., this module will 
      deal with writing a news release for a local newspaper. This approach will 
      give you a useful skill and provide the basis for improving your writing 
      for as long or short a period as you choose.</P>
      <P>Newspapers, like radio and television, are mass media that can and 
      should be used by educators and other community development workers. Mass 
      media are essential for announcing meetings and events outside of the 
      small circle that can be contacted by telephone or face to face.</P>
      <P>You do not have to be an expert to prepare news releases. Some 
      knowledge about your organization and its activities is all you need to 
      begin a news release whether it is for a newspaper, the radio or 
      television. What is the event or activity that you wish to publicize? This 
      is your topic. Write it down. Now ask yourself the following questions and 
      write down the answers.</P>

            show up at the same time.</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD width=104>WHY</TD>
          <TD>League purposes are to provide a safe, healthy activity for all 
            youth, to teach teamwork, and to strengthen families.</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD width=104>RESULTS</TD>
          <TD>Everyone who registers will be placed on a team. All registered 
            players (who attend practice) will play at least half of every game. 
            Teams will practice twice each week and play every Saturday. Teams 
            are formed of youth in two-year age groups: 6- 7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, 
            14-15, and 16-18. Practices start August 15. Games are scheduled 
            from September 7 through November 15.</TD></TR>
        <TR>
          <TD width=104>OTHER DETAILS</TD>
          <TD>Youth soccer is the fastest growing sport in our state. Last 
            year 814 youth played soccer in our league. This is recreational 
            soccer as opposed to all-star or highly competitive soccer. No 
            league champions are determined. Placings are not announced. No body 
            is required to travel beyond the Verde Valley. Parents and other 
            adults are needed to be coaches, referees, and "team mothers." No 
            previous soccer experience is needed. Workshops are provided for 
            coaches and referees.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>Now write the essential information in paragraph form. The first 
      paragraph is the most important. It should get attention and tell "who, 
      what, where, when, why." Following paragraphs give increasingly less 
      important information which may be cut if space is limited.</P>
      <P><B>Example:</B></P>
      <P>Everyone plays in the Verde Valley youth soccer league. Sign ups for 
      the fall season will be 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Saturday July 2 and July 
      9, 1999, at the Verde Valley Fairgrounds for boys and girls ages 8 through 
      18. A birth certificate, a parent to sign the registration form, and a 
      check (or cash) for $25 is all you need to sign up.</P>
      <P>Everyone who registers will be assigned to a team. Every team member 
      who attends practice will play at least half of every game. Teams are made 
      up of two-year age groups. They play teams of the same age. No travel 
      outside the Verde Valley is required. Practices start August 15 and each 
      team will play every Saturday between September 7 and November 15. The $25 
      pays for a uniform and for league costs including referees.</P>
      <P>Adults are needed for coaches, referees and team mothers. No soccer 
      experience is required. Workshops will be scheduled for coaches and 
      referees.</P>
      <P>The Verde Valley youth soccer league is a recreational soccer program. 
      Its purposes are to provide a safe, healthy activity for youth, to teach 
      teamwork, and to strengthen families. No champions are declared and no 
      team standings are published. This is the tenth year for the league. Last 
      year 814 youth participated.</P>
      <P>The Verde Valley Fairgrounds is located at 104 Main Street in 
      Cottonwood. The entrance is beside the A &amp; W Drive-in. The sign up 
      process will take 10-30 minutes depending on the number registering at any 
      particular time.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE: IMPROVE YOUR WRITING SKILLS</P>
      <P>Show your article to a friend or colleague who has equal or better 
      writing skills. Ask him or her to critique your article for clarity and to 
      note any errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style. Take the 
      article to a news reporter who is interested in your subject (newspapers 
      assign reporters to the "sports beat," community news, school activities, 
      etc.). Many times a reporter will be willing to critique your article and 
      make suggestions for improvement. The reporter will also tell you how and 
      when to submit such articles for publication.</P>
      <P>By repeating this process (outline, write, critique, revise) you will 
      strengthen your writing skills. Any writer will tell you that the best way 
      to improve your writing skills is to keep writing.
