      <H2>Teaching Behaviors C-7</H2><I>
      <P align=center>What is it that educators do which makes them effective? 
      What teacher behaviors cause learning to occur?</I> </P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>When you finish this module you should be able</P>
      <P>1. to list the top five teaching behaviors, according to research, 
      which are most important to promote learning;<BR>2. to describe what an 
      educator does to effectively use each of these behaviors; and<BR>3. to 
      describe small group techniques which effective educators often use.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>FIVE BEHAVIORS</H3>
      <P>According to Rosenshine and Furst (1971) the factors which distinguish 
      effective educators are clarity, enthusiasm, providing a learning 
      opportunity for students, a business-like approach, and use of 
variety.</P>
      <P><B>Clarity</B> means communicating effectively, using examples and 
      repeating the message. It includes asking for feedback and demonstrating 
      actions or results. Clarity means setting standards and rules but 
      adjusting them to the learners.</P>
      <P><B>Enthusiasm</B> means showing excitement, showing interest in the 
      subject and the learners, and getting involved with the learners.</P>
      <P><B>Providing a learning opportunity </B>for learners means carefully 
      writing objectives that address learners' needs, planning the instruction 
      so that learners will be actively involved then have a chance to apply 
      what they have studied. Learning is followed by evaluation by the educator 
      of the learners, by learner evaluation of the learners and by learner 
      evaluation of the learning opportunity.</P>
      <P><B>A business-like approach</B> means that time is well organized and 
      sequenced for purposeful learning. Learners do not respect a teacher that 
      wastes time. Humor and an entertaining personality are positive attributes 
      in a teacher but they do not substitute for thorough organization and 
      careful preparation.</P>
      <P><B>Variety</B> can refer to instructional materials (use different 
      types of materials), teaching procedures (frequent change in routine), 
      activities (give learners choices and learning options) and the 
      presentation itself.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>SOME TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE EDUCATORS</H3>
      <P>Module C-8 describes a fuller range of teaching/learning options. Some 
      of those techniques take time to understand and experience to use them 
      effectively. The following techniques can be used for large groups when 
      they are broken into smaller groups. These techniques are great for 
      variety and for involving learners as active participants.</P>
      <P>Co-leaders in group discussions - the use of a team approach of two or 
      more persons in leading a discussion.</P>
      <P>Huddle groups - the use of a group of five persons for the discussion 
      of a problem or issue, and they reporting to a larger group.</P>
      <P>Buzz groups - the use of a group of 12-15 persons for the discussion of 
      a problem or issue, and then reporting to a larger group.</P>
      <P>Phillips 66 technique - the use of a group of six persons for the 
      discussion of a problem for six minutes, and then reporting to a larger 
      group.</P>
      <P>Leadership team - the use of a group of four persons to conduct a 
      discussion as follows: discussion leader, process observer, recorder, and 
      resource person.</P>
      <P>Listening team - the use of two to four persons who listen, evaluate, 
      and then pose questions to persons who have made a formal 
presentation.</P>
      <P>Role playing - the use of persons who act out a situation in order to 
      promote additional insights or deeper emotional feelings.</P>
      <P>Brainstorming - the use of free expression to further creative thinking 
      without the influence of judicial reasoning.</P>
      <P>Diads - the use of pairs to interview each other or clarify their own 
      ideas.</P>
      <P>Triads - the use of three people to discuss a problem or interact with 
      each other. <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE><!--This file created 4:48 PM  2/9/99 by Claris Home Page version 3.0--></BODY></HTML>
