      <H2>Non-verbal Communication C-5</H2><I>
      <P align=center>You catch more flies with syrup than with vinegar.</I> 
</P>
      <P>During interpersonal communication we communicate in two ways: verbally 
      and non- verbally. Unless the nonverbal message is consistent with the 
      verbal message, we communicate contradictory or confusing messages.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Recognize the importance of non-verbal communication.<BR>2. Observe 
      non-verbal communication which supports or contradicts the verbal 
      message.<BR>3. Practice non-verbal communication which is consistent with 
      a verbal message.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE NON-VERBALLY</H3>
      <P>We communicate non-verbally by facial expressions, gestures, posture, 
      bodily action, eye contact, and personal appearance. We do this 
      consciously sometimes but usually we do it unconsciously. There are 
      approximately 700,000 non-verbal signals that have been identified. We can 
      improve our communication if we can become aware of unconscious signals 
      that we give which contradict or distract from our verbal message. We can 
      also consciously use non-verbal messages to reinforce our verbal message. 
      This takes effort to observe non-verbal messages, to understand when they 
      support and when they distract from the verbal message, to anticipate 
      situations when we wish to consciously use non-verbal communication, and 
      to practice (rehearse then use) non- verbal reinforcement properly.</P>
      <P>Consider some examples:</P>
      <P><B>Facial expression</B> indicates joy, fear, confidence, 
      attentiveness, sadness, anger, friendliness, hostility, etc. Use the 
      friendly smile to break the ice and communicate openness.</P>
      <P><B>Gestures </B>can encourage or discourage contact. Stroking the chin 
      may indicate thoughtfulness--that the listener is considering what was 
      just said. Rubbing the nose may indicate disbelief or even contempt. Arms 
      locked across the chest may indicate defensiveness or hostility. Clenched 
      fists may indicate nervousness, fear or hostility. Some "public speakers" 
      have learned to "over use" gestures. Waving arms and mechanically repeated 
      hand gestures can detract from the verbal message. Use natural gestures 
      with the hands to illustrate or emphasize a point. Do not clasp your hands 
      or just let them hang at your sides or always keep them in your pockets. 
      These gestures (of lack of gestures) make you appear stiff and/or nervous. 
      The ability to use natural gestures can be improved with practice and 
      experience.</P>
      <P><B>Posture</B> should be natural, not exaggerated. Slumping indicates 
      laziness or lack of interest. Rigid posture indicates fear or nervousness. 
      Leaning slightly toward a person indicates respect and attentiveness. 
      Leaning slightly backward at the appropriate time can reinforce that you 
      are seriously considering what was said (especially when used with facial 
      expression and gestures). Posture is particularly important when listening 
      to a speaker. People like to "get comfortable" but in so doing they may 
      give the speaker the message that they are not listening or that they are 
      bored. Practice sitting up straight and leaning forward to give the 
      speaker a positive non-verbal message (taking notes helps if you lean 
      forward and write on a table or desk arm).</P>
      <P><B>Bodily action</B> -- jerky movements may indicate nervousness, 
      impatience or hostility. They usually detract from the spoken word. When 
      speaking before groups don't pace back an forth; don't rock from one foot 
      to another; don't bob your shoulders. Don't unnecessarily shuffle your 
      notes or play with jewelry or coins in your pocket. To put a person at 
      ease keep your bodily movements slow and smooth. Don't persistently groom 
      yourself (ie., brush your hair back with your hand. This may communicate 
      lack of confidence, or that you are preoccupied with yourself--even 
      self-centered. During an interview or office conference when you are 
      trying to make a favorable impression, avoid tapping your shoe on the 
      floor or your fingers on anything. A variation of this sign of impatience 
      is to cross your legs and move your foot rhythmically. Watch for the 
      person to sit up in his/her chair. This may mean that your time is up. If 
      you want to give a non-verbal message that you need to end a conversation 
      in your office, trying shifting forward in your chair. Do it smoothly and 
      slightly the first time. Then try a slightly more abrupt movement. If it 
      does not work then you may need to tell the person that you have another 
      appointment or a need to finish your work before you can continue.</P>
      <P><B>Eye contact</B> is important to show respect and attentiveness (but 
      not in all cultures). This non-verbal message, like virtually all of them, 
      can be over used and therefore distract. The eyeball itself shows no 
      expression. The tissue around your eyes can be used purposefully (usually 
      for facial expression). Avoid scowls or blank stares. Maintaining eye 
      contact for a few seconds emphasizes a point. Be careful of looking out 
      the window or focusing on an object in the room when communicating 
      interpersonally. When speaking to groups try to establish eye contact with 
      various people in different parts of the room.</P>
      <P><B>Personal appearance</B> includes cleanliness, neatness, grooming, 
      and clothes appropriate to the occasion. You can overdress for some 
      occasions. College professors who overdress or wear reading glasses in 
      informal community meetings support the stereotype of "ivory tower 
      intellectuals who have nothing practical to offer." Many people like to 
      establish their "identity" or individual uniqueness through exaggerated 
      grooming or clothing. This can distract from effective communication. It 
      may stereotype the individual in a way that is detrimental to 
      communication.</P>
      <P><I>Caution!!!</I> The examples given above are indications, not 
      absolute rules. Non-verbal signals can be easily misinterpreted. Before 
      reacting to a non-verbal signal, look for other signals that support or 
      neutralize it.</P>
      <P>Likewise avoid using non-verbal gestures to manipulate other people. 
      Your lack of sincerity will get you into more trouble than occasionally 
      and inadvertently misusing nonverbal signals.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</P>
      <P>1. Can you add to the examples of non-verbal signals which can help or 
      hinder communication.</P>
      <P>2. What non-verbal signals irritate you most?</P>
      <P>3. What non-verbal signals do you consciously use to reinforce your 
      message?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE:</P>
      <P>Take turns role-playing the following situations. Those who are not in 
      the role play should take notes on non-verbal signals that help or detract 
      from the verbal message.</P>
      <P>1. Office visit to get acquainted. Both individuals want to get 
      acquainted with the other person and make a favorable impression. Both 
      consider that the other person may be a helpful collaborator on some 
      project in the future.</P>
      <P>2. Office interview. One person interviews the other person who has 
      applied to be the interviewer's personal secretary. Three other equally 
      qualified applicants are waiting to be interviewed.</P>
      <P>3. Conflict. Person #1 is the boss of #2. #2 has received an annual 
      evaluation that is slightly below last year's evaluation. #2 is unhappy 
      because performance and accomplishment have been equal to last year's. #1 
      firmly believes that the evaluation was correct, that #2 is a valuable 
      employee but can improve in performance and accomplishment.</P>
      <P>4. Conflict. Person #1 is President of a volunteer organization. #2 is 
      a volunteer who is frustrated with the organization and wants to drop out. 
      Since they have always been friends #2 wants to tell #1 face to face 
      before simply dropping out.</P>
      <P>5. Give an extemporaneous speech in which you wish to convince the 
      group (representing the parks and recreation committee) that they should 
      use new funds to build tennis courts rather than a swimming pool. Most of 
      the group favors a swimming pool.</P>
      <P>6. Design your own role play situation based on experiences that you 
      have had when your interpersonal communication was misinterpreted.</P>
      <P>7. Design a role play based on an upcoming event when you need to use 
      effective communication in a delicate situation.</P>
      <P>After each role play, discuss what happened (both role players and 
      observers). Discuss non-verbal signals which were used or misused. Decide 
      how the role players could have improved their non-verbal communication 
      skills. <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE><!--This file created 4:47 PM  2/9/99 by Claris Home Page version 3.0--></BODY></HTML>
