      <H2>Interpersonal Communication C-1</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Too much talk spoils everything.</I> </P>
      <P>How well we communicate is key to our effectiveness in life. Some 
      people use the excuse, "I'm not a public speaker," to avoid assessing and 
      improving their communication skills. In this chapter, participants will 
      learn how to speak up for themselves more effectively, whether speaking to 
      one person or one hundred.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe the difference between task and relationship-oriented 
      communication.<BR>2. Assess your present communication style.<BR>3. 
      Describe the difference between "I" and "You" statements, and their impact 
      on others.<BR>4. Plan specific actions to become a more effective 
      speaker.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>TASK OR RELATIONSHIP ORIENTED COMMUNICATION</H3>
      <P>The way we express ourselves can either turn people on or turn them 
      off. It can either gain their support or lose it. Sometimes, we turn 
      people off, unintentionally. It is through communication that differing 
      needs and opinions are expressed and worked out. It is through 
      communication that information is shared, consensus developed and superior 
      group decisions made. Also, it is primarily through communication that 
      people are motivated. How then can each of us become more effective in 
      motivating others through our communications?</P>
      <P>Much of our communication is task oriented, that is, we communicate 
      with a purpose, to work things out, to make a decision, to accomplish a 
      desired goal. We become more persuasive by being logical, well organized 
      and prepared with good information. Effective communication, however, goes 
      beyond winning and getting your way. Most of our accomplishments, and 
      pleasures, in life come out of on-going relationships. Effective 
      communication builds and strengthens those relationships.</P>
      <P>Some people are very task oriented, down to business. They quickly 
      become impatient. They often have strong opinions as to what is "right." 
      They use their power to pressure people, and are willing to sacrifice 
      relationships to get a decision made and the job done. They do more 
      telling than listening.</P>
      <P>Other people are very relationship oriented--"We're all a big happy 
      family." They are afraid to speak up for fear of hurting feelings, and as 
      a result shy away from substance.</P>
      <P>Good communication must be both relationship and task oriented. The 
      objective of effective interpersonal communication is to share openly and 
      meaningfully with one another in a caring, respectful manner.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>ON BEING ASSERTIVE</H3>
      <P>Many of us could become more effective in speaking up for ourselves by 
      being more assertive. Unfortunately, many people misunderstand what being 
      assertive means. They incorrectly assume that being assertive means being 
      aggressive. The distinction is important. The study of assertiveness 
      identifies four styles of behavior in communicating with others.[1] Most 
      of us use all four of these styles, to varying degrees, in our daily 
      interactions.</P>
      <P><B>Passive or submissive behavior,</B> involves allowing others to take 
      advantage of you--by failing to speak up for yourself. When non-assertive 
      persons do express their thoughts and feelings, they often do so in an 
      indirect, apologetic, timid, self-depreciating manner that others can 
      easily disregard. "It won't do any good, anyway" is a common excuse used 
      by non-assertive people for not speaking up. Such people often have a 
      strong need to please others, and disguise their true feelings for fear of 
      offending. Rather than being open and honest with one another, they are 
      guarded in their comments. The choice of a passive role can be appropriate 
      when the issue is not of great concern to us, or when we trust the 
      superior knowledge and skills of others. The passive role becomes negative 
      when we choose it habitually.</P>
      <P><B>Aggressive behavior,</B> at the opposite extreme, is based on 
      accusing, directing, overpowering other people, intimidating them, putting 
      them down, making them feel guilty--in order to get your way. The 
      aggressive person forces his feelings, needs and ideas on others. 
      Aggressive people are often blunt, have a need to control, are often 
      insensitive to the needs and feelings of others, are poor listeners, and 
      exhibit a selfish single-mindedness that often results in domination. 
      Aggressive behavior often triggers a guarded, defensive response from 
      others, and a breakdown in communication results. Aggressive behavior can 
      be a sign of an insecure person. Such people overcompensate for their 
      insecurities through domineering behaviors.</P>
      <P>People who typically behave in submissive ways often accumulate 
      enormous amounts of frustration that finally erupt in an aggressive 
      outburst, followed by feelings of guilt and a return to a submissive 
      behavior pattern. This is called passive-aggressive behavior. In both 
      passive and aggressive behaviors, people typically disguise what they 
      really want to say by downplaying or exaggerating. This gives others a 
      confusing message.</P>
      <P><B>Martyr behavior</B> uses pessimism and guilt to manipulate others. 
      Martyrs are often closed to new ideas, are prone to use the past to 
      predict the future in negative ways, and like to blame others. They get 
      their way by making others feel sorry for them. We may appropriately 
      choose to be a martyr by knowingly risking our reputation and public image 
      to support a controversial cause or person we strongly believe in.</P>
      <P><B>Assertive behavior</B> provides an alternative to the extremes of 
      the previous three behaviors. Being assertive involves expressing your 
      needs concerns, ideas and feelings openly in a straightforward, but 
      caring, respectful manner without dominating, judging, directing, or 
      depreciating the other person. The objective of assertive behavior is 
      improved communication--the sharing of information in getting yours and 
      the other person's feelings, needs, concerns out in the open where they 
      can be dealt with constructively. Being assertive involves confronting in 
      a straightforward, but caring manner that maintains the other person's 
      self-esteem and strengthens your relationship. The goal of assertive 
      behavior is to get and give respect, to jointly resolve differences, and 
      to allow for compromise when conflicts arise.</P>
      <P>Not only does being assertive lead to more pleasant interpersonal 
      relations, it also is generally more effective in getting what you want. 
      Why? Because most people become cooperative when they are approached in an 
      open, straightforward, respectful, non-manipulative manner.</P>
      <P>These four models of behavior are presented to help you assess your 
      communication style and its impact on others. You will from time to time 
      use all four. This is to be expected. Most important, you have a choice as 
      to which style you use. As you face different situations, ask yourself, 
      "What kind of response am I getting? Would greater use of the assertive 
      style make me more effective?" Specific techniques in how to become more 
      assertive follow.</P>
      <P align=center>Before reading further, complete the following 
      Assertiveness Quiz. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>INSTRUCTIONS: Review the listed responses to the underlined situations: 
      (1) Put an "X" by those responses you frequently use. (2) In the right 
      hand margin categorize each response as either passive, aggressive, martyr 
      or assertive.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>A. <B>When I am disappointed or upset with someone, I usually:</B></P>
      <P>1. don't say anything, because I'm afraid I'll hurt his feelings.<BR>2. 
      drop hints, hoping she will get the message.<BR>3. put it off, because I'm 
      unsure of what I should say.<BR>4. confront him with "exactly how I 
      feel."<BR>5. express my feelings sarcastically--getting my point across 
      indirectly through humor.<BR>6. whine and complain to others.<BR>7. 
      lecture her with "shoulds" and "oughts."<BR>8. avoid saying anything, 
      because I know it won't do any good. It will only lead to more 
      conflict.<BR>9. speak to the person privately, and express my concerns in 
      a direct, but caring manner.</P>
      <P>B. <B>When someone asks me to do a favor and I don't want to do it, I 
      usually:</B></P>
      <P>1. do it anyway.<BR>2. resent the request and act imposed upon.<BR>3. 
      make up excuses as to why I can't do it.<BR>4. do it grudgingly, and 
      complain to others.<BR>5. apologize profusely, and tell her I'm not able 
      to do it.<BR>6. say "no," but allow myself to get talked into it.<BR>7. in 
      a respectful manner, firmly say "I'd rather not."</P>
      <H3 align=center>I- MESSAGES</H3>
      <P>How effective do you feel you are in expressing yourself? How do people 
      usually respond to what you say? Do they become defensive and 
      argumentative? Do they tend to disregard or treat lightly what you say? Or 
      do they pay attention and respond cooperatively?</P>
      <P>A simple technique follows in helping you become more effective in 
      speaking up for yourself. The technique is particularly effective when you 
      have a problem or concern to bring up, when you are disturbed by someone 
      else's behavior, when you wish to express a differing point of view, or 
      otherwise find yourself in a potential conflict situation.</P>
      <P><B>I-MESSAGES: How to express yourself in a manner so that others will 
      listen to you and take heed.</B> I-messages involve expressing your need, 
      concern, opinion or feelings precisely through statements that begin with 
      the word "I" as opposed to sentences that begin with impersonal pronouns 
      such as "you" "they" "we" "it." It involves saying "I feel..." rather than 
      "It would be best if..." "I don't understand" vs. "It's not clear....." "I 
      would like....." vs "You should...." "I'm upset about...." vs "You upset 
      me." "I suggest..." vs "You haven't considered...." "I would prefer we not 
      vote on this until we first explore other alternatives" vs. "You are 
      trying to ram this through." "I need your help in distributing the 
      announcements" vs "You're not doing your share." "I would prefer you not 
      smoke" rather than say nothing.</P>
      <P>I-messages inform the other person of your frustration, your 
      disappointment, without accusing him or her of causing it. I- messages 
      inform the other person of your needs, your thoughts, your opinions, 
      without judging, or directing, or pressuring the other person to think the 
      same way. I-messages clearly indicate to the other person how his or her 
      behavior is interfering with your efforts to meet your own needs and then 
      leaves responsibility for any change in that person's behavior with the 
      other person, where it belongs.</P>
      <P>When you have a concern, frustration or problem, clearly describe in 
      your I-message (a) the specific behavior troubling you and (b) the impact 
      that behavior is having on you and/or others. Don't convey judgment or 
      blame. For example, "I am concerned that as chairman you are doing much of 
      the talking; as a result, members don't get as involved in the decision" 
      versus "You're dominating; let others have an opportunity to speak, too." 
      "I get annoyed when you arrive late" vs. "If you cared, you'd be on 
      time."</P>
      <P>You will be amazed how direct and frank you can be, and still not make 
      the other person defensive, when you start your sentences with "I." Try 
      it. "I am concerned about...." "I would like to...." "I'm frustrated 
      over...." "I would like us to consider...." "I was embarrassed by...." "I 
      got angry when...." "I'm worried about...."</P>
      <P><B>ROAD BLOCKS TO COMMUNICATION: Why people become defensive and resist 
      what YOU have to say. </B>Unfortunately, instead of sending an I-message 
      when we have a problem, are annoyed, have a different opinion, or wish to 
      make a suggestion, we usually send a solution message as to what the other 
      person should do. This involves directing, warning, threatening, 
      moralizing, advising and giving suggestions. People generally resist being 
      told what to do.</P>
      <P>Or we send a <B>put-down message s</B>uch as "That was a mistake." "You 
      shouldn't have done that." "Don't argue with your mother." "We all know 
      that won't work." "That's a poor idea." Such statements communicate blame, 
      judgment, ridicule, criticism, shame. Such put-down messages usually cause 
      resistance, guilt feelings, excuse making, an urge to fight back and get 
      even, and/or a feeling of rejection.</P>
      <P>Or we send a <B>you-message: </B>"You made me mad." "You haven't 
      considered...." "You aren't being cooperative." "You should have...." "You 
      ought to...." You-statements tend to provoke counter you-statements and 
      cause the discussion to degenerate into verbal battle.</P>
      <P>In short, we tend to "parent" others, and the minute we do, we block 
      communications. Our ego often gets in the way and we become more concerned 
      with straightening the person out than in communicating and improving the 
      relationship. Catch yourself. Express your problem, opinion, frustration 
      through I-messages. Take full responsibility for what you say. Then allow 
      the other person to take responsibility for his/her own statements, 
      actions and reactions.</P>
      <P>The I-MESSAGE is not a panacea to improved communication. It is not 
      appropriate in all situations. It can, however, be a very effective tool 
      in improving communication between yourself and your family as well as in 
      business and community relationships.</P>
      <P>An admonition: I-Statements can have a negative impact if they are used 
      in an aggressive, self-righteous manner to impose and threaten, ("I demand 
      that...." "I was insulted by...."). The tone of voice alone can turn an 
      assertive, respectful statement into a threatening, aggressive one. For an 
      I-Message to be effective, it must clearly state your need, wish or 
      opinion without judging, directing or pressuring the other person.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>EXERCISE 1:</B> Review your responses to the "Assertiveness Quiz" 
      (above) and compare with the following answers. Several of the responses 
      could be categorized differently depending on how they were said.</P>
      <P>Passive: A-l, A-2, A-3, A-8, B-1, B-3, B-5, B-6</P>
      <P>Aggressive: A-4, A-5, A-7, B-2</P>
      <P>Martyr: A-5, A-6, B-3</P>
      <P>Assertive: A-9, B-7</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>EXERCISE 2: </B>Complete the "I-Messages Worksheet" (below). Share 
      and discuss your responses with others in your study group.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>EXERCISE 3: </B>On a separate sheet of paper, write (a) passive, (b) 
      aggressive, (c) martyr and (d) assertive responses to each of the 
      following situations.</P>
      <P>1. Refuse an extra helping of food at a dinner party.</P>
      <P>2. Get a group back on the subject after they have wandered off on a 
      tangent.</P>
      <P>3. Control an excessive talker who is dominating the discussion.</P>
      <P>4. You have been interrupted, and wish to complete your thought.</P>
      <P>5. A second conversation has started up in the back of the room and is 
      distracting from the meeting.</P>
      <P>If you are in a study group, review each of the five situations, and 
      have different individuals role play their assertive response, how they 
      would "speak up for themselves" in handling the situation. Have the person 
      speak directly to the group or to a designated individual who is to role 
      play the problem person as described in the situation. For example, in 
      situation #1, "June would role play the dinner host (cook) as she offers 
      an extra helping of food; Bob you refuse it, in an assertive caring 
      manner." Instruct the role players to speak directly to one 
      another--"don't explain how you would do it, do it." Ask the group to 
      critique the response. Change role players, and role play another response 
      to the same situation. There is no single right answer.</P>
      <P>After 5-10 minutes, move on to another of the listed situations. Be 
      supportive of the role players. Undertake as many of the listed situations 
      as time permits.</P>
      <H3 align=center>I-MESSAGES: WORKSHEET</H3>
      <P>Several potential conflict situations are described below. Indicate how 
      you might handle each situation, first using a "YOU" message, and then 
      using an "I" message. Which is likely to get the best results? Beware of 
      the disguised "you" statements, ("I feel you are dominating the 
      meeting").</P>
