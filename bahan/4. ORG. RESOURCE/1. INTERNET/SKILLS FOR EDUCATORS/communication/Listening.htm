      <H2>Listening C-2</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Flies (and feet) won't enter a closed mouth.</I> </P>
      <P>We spend more time each day listening than we do speaking or writing. 
      Yet we receive less training for effective listening skills than for the 
      other two forms of communication.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>By the time you finish this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Identify skills and habits of effective listening.<BR>2. Improve 
      your listening skills and habits.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>LISTEN TO GET AND GIVE FEEDBACK</H3>
      <P>Good communication is a two-way process. People tend to listen to you 
      when you listen to them. Once you have spoken, the other person often 
      responds. When that occurs, take time to listen. If your mind is 
      preoccupied with what you are going to say next, you aren't listening. 
      Instead, give the other person the attention and respect that you in turn 
      would like from her.</P>
      <P>Listening involves more than hearing. It involves a certain physical 
      presence with that person--facing the person squarely, with an open 
      posture, preferably within arms length, with good eye contact. Listening 
      begins with a door opener, an invitation to give feedback: "Tell me about 
      it," "What is your opinion?" Listening then involves giving verbal and 
      non-verbal feedback that conveys understanding and respect. Acknowledge 
      and paraphrase your understanding of the other person's message: "You feel 
      that..." "I can see your point." "What do you mean by...?" Probe for 
      further clarification of the person's underlying needs and concerns. Avoid 
      "why" questions, which put the person on the defensive. In short, a good 
      communicator knows how to listen--as well as speak.</P>
      <P>Let's review briefly the communication process. In my head I have a 
      certain thought or emotion that I wish to convey. I convert that image 
      into a coded message that consists of words and nonverbal expression, 
      which I transmit to another person. The receiver then interprets the 
      meaning of that verbal/nonverbal message. Communication breaks down when 
      the sender and receiver assign different meaning to the coded message 
      sent. In short, what the other person heard was not what I intended.</P>
      <P>We must regularly check signals--to insure that both the sender and 
      receiver assign the same meaning to the message sent. We do this by 
      seeking and giving feedback: "Please summarize for me what you understood 
      me to say." "If understood you correctly, you think 
      (feel/suggest/want)...." A good communicator takes care to clarify 
      meanings.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>TAKE TIME TO LISTEN</H3>
      <P>Effective communication involves listening more than persuasion. It 
      involves tuning in and building on the ideas of others. Rarely do people 
      get as excited about another person's idea as they do about their own 
      idea. We often turn people off by not responding appropriately. People are 
      more likely to listen to you when you have listened to them. Effective 
      communication is a two-way process. Feedback is essential to good 
      decisions.</P>
      <P>Listening is also very effective in resolving conflict and in working 
      out differences. We typically respond to challenges by becoming more 
      forceful in reaffirming the rationale and logic of our position. We point 
      out the weaknesses of the opposing position, and defend ourselves to any 
      criticism. This heats up the transaction, and triggers our emotions. 
      Listening, in contrast cools the transaction, uncovers miscommunication, 
      heightens understanding and shows respect. Most conflict is the result of 
      miscommunication.</P>
      <P>When people become disruptive, e.g., repeat themselves, raise their 
      voices, dominate the discussion, become emotional and argumentative, it is 
      a sure sign they feel they are not being listened to, understood or 
      respected. This behavior will continue until you prove to them otherwise. 
      Also, listening can be therapeutic in helping volunteer leaders work out 
      the frustrations they encounter in community service.</P>
      <P>Empathetic listening is likewise effective in getting people to open up 
      and share with you, to reveal their real needs and true feelings, to 
      participate and become more active. A major cause of apathy is the failure 
      of you and me to really listen.</P>
      <P>Good people managers are aware of the importance of listening. They are 
      aware that listening involves more than hearing and understanding the 
      other person. They know that for listening to be motivational, it must be 
      clearly demonstrated. The other person must feel listened to, understood 
      and respected. Otherwise the motivational power of listening is lost. In 
      short, listening must be active to be effective.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>SKILLS/ATTITUDES FOR EFFECTIVE LISTENING</H3>
      <P><B>Be attentive.</B> Get in a straight line with the person, preferably 
      within arms length. Make regular eye contact. Look alive and 
      interested.</P>
      <P><B>Physically react. </B>Nod, smile, shake your head in agreement or 
      disagreement, take notes, say "mm-hm" or "good point," "tell me more," "I 
      see," "explain that further," "go on," in support of what the person said. 
      Your stern unexpressive face tells people you're not interested, whether 
      you are or not.</P>
      <P><B>Reflect. </B>Summarize back to the person, in your own words, what 
      you feel were the key points made: "You feel...." "You are concerned 
      with..." Such reflecting shows you are listening and interested in what 
      the person has to say. It can also nip in the bud misunderstandings. 
      Paraphrase, don't parrot.</P>
      <P><B>Reflect the feelings</B> as well as the verbal content of the 
      message: "You were annoyed by...," "You sound troubled."</P>
      <P><B>Ask questions.</B> Seek clarification of the facts and the feelings. 
      Use questions to get information rather than manipulate the 
      conversation.</P>
      <P><B>Don't judge.</B> Put aside the need to persuade, to defend yourself, 
      to judge and to argue with what is being said. Instead concentrate on 
      trying to understand the other person's point of view. Give people the 
      time they need to express themselves. Show you care. People will be open 
      to you only after you have been open to them.</P>
      <P><B>Show acceptance.</B> Say, "Good point." "It took a lot of courage to 
      share that with me, thanks." "I can see you've given this a lot of 
      thought." Demonstrate to people that their views are important to the 
      discussion at hand, even though you may sometimes disagree with them. 
      Acceptance doesn't have to mean agreement.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</H3>
      <P>1. Do you use effective listening techniques?</P>
      <P>2. What happens to your listen skills when you are under pressure?</P>
      <P>3. How might you improve your own habits?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
