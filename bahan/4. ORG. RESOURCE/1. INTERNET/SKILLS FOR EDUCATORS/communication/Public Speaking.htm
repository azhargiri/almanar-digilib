      <H2>Public Speaking C-3</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Think (a lot) before you speak.</I> </P>
      <P>How well we communicate with others is key to our effectiveness and 
      success in life. Communication is particularly important in leadership. We 
      will all find ourselves in different leadership roles, from time to time, 
      whether we view ourselves as leaders or not. It might be as a coach for a 
      Little League team, or a member of a church group, or an officer in a 
      community organization, or it might involve speaking up in a meeting. Our 
      effectiveness in these situations depends on our ability to 
      communicate.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After completing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Prepare a speech.<BR>2. Improve your speech delivery.<BR>3. Evaluate 
      a speech given by yourself or someone else.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>PREPARING TO SPEAK</H3>
      <P>Many people are fearful of speaking before others, and they shy away 
      from it at all costs. In a national survey, people were questioned as to 
      their greatest fear in life. The fear listed more often than any other 
      (41%) was "speaking before others." We can overcome that attitude of fear 
      through preparation and practice.</P>
      <P>Speaking before others can either become a major barrier, or an avenue 
      to success and accomplishment in life. Learning to speak before others, in 
      small social groups as well as in larger community groups, provides us 
      with one of the greatest opportunities we have for personal growth.</P>
      <P>How can you become more effective in speaking up for yourself? The 
      following pointers are as pertinent to one-on-one communication as they 
      are to speaking before a group.</P>
      <P>KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE: The makeup of your audience (whether one person or 
      one hundred) greatly influences what you are able to say, and how you say 
      it. People don't have to listen to you, and they won't unless they want 
      to. People are more likely to give you their attention <I>if you speak to 
      their needs, concerns and interests.</I> Take time to analyze the person 
      or group you'll be speaking to. If you don't know the person or group, 
      consult with someone who does. What are their expectations of you? Use 
      illustrations that are pertinent and meaningful to your audience. Have 
      your facts together, and adapt them to the needs and interests of the 
      listener. Avoid inflammatory statements.</P>
      <P>Analyze your audience not only before you speak but also while you are 
      speaking. Pick up and respond to your audience's nonverbal reactions. Seek 
      questions and feedback. Adjust your comments accordingly.</P>
      <P>Getting your point across and getting people to take action sometimes 
      require waiting for the right time, "the teachable moment." Pushing a 
      point before people are ready for it can become a futile effort. Know your 
      audience.</P>
      <P><B>BE PREPARED:</B> Think through what you want to say, and how you are 
      going to say it. The biggest mistake most of us make is not being 
      prepared. We know we might be called upon, or that there is an action we 
      wish to support or oppose, and yet we avoid thinking about what we would 
      say until that time arrives.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>THE SPEECH</H3>
      <P>The following suggestions will be helpful in preparing yourself to 
      speak, whether to two or three people or to a large group.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>OPENER</B></P>
      <P>Have a prepared opener, a two or three sentence lead-in that grabs your 
      listeners, and clearly states what you hope to accomplish in speaking to 
      them: "I'm a 4-H member, and I'd like to share with you what 4-H has done 
      for me." "I support this proposal (motion), and the reasons I do are..." 
      Get the opening clearly fixed in your mind. Many people suffer a moment of 
      panic just as they begin to speak. This prepared opener will get you over 
      that moment of panic.</P>
      <P>As you prepare to talk, take a couple of deep breaths to calm yourself. 
      Stand (If the group is small and informal, you may choose to remain 
      seated). Standing brings attention to you and will strengthen your impact 
      on the group. Position yourself so that you can see everyone, with no one 
      to your back. Make eye contact. Acknowledge any introduction with "thank 
      you". Pause for attention. Don't apologize: "I'm not prepared," or "I'm 
      not a very good speaker," or "I didn't know I was going to be called 
      upon." Don't hem and haw around. Don't use common- place clichés like, 
      "It's a pleasure to be here." Instead start right off with your prepared 
      opening statement.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>BODY</B></P>
      <P>Then in the body of your presentation, include the logic, facts, 
      examples, the points you wish to make. Clearly indicate what you would 
      like your listeners to do with the information you are providing them. 
      Outline the points you wish to make. Think through the ordering and 
      organization of those points, and how you will make the transition from 
      one point to the next, from the opener to the conclusion. Know what you 
      are going to say, and then say it.</P>
      <P>Your message will be strengthened if you can: Incorporate vivid 
      examples. Share actual experience. Make a comparison or analogy that your 
      audience can relate to: "Have you ever...?" Touch briefly on arguments 
      that oppose your viewpoint, showing their weakness. Quote an authority, or 
      use simple statistics to support your argument.</P>
      <P>In your delivery, make eye contact. Speak directly to individuals in 
      your audience. Pick out a face, focus on it for several seconds, then move 
      on to another. Vary your speaking pace and the loudness of your voice. Use 
      gestures and appropriate pauses to keep the attention of your 
audience.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>CLOSING</B></P>
      <P>Finally, write out a two or three sentence closing that summarizes the 
      key points you've made. Strive for a climax, a challenge, a call for 
      action that will leave your message clearly in the listeners' minds. 
      Memorize it. The closing is your point of greatest potential impact. Don't 
      give it away by sitting down abruptly with "Well, that's about all I have 
      to say." If you run out of time, calmly move into your prepared 
      conclusion, and no one will know the difference.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>PRESENTATION TIPS</H3>
      <P>GET TO THE POINT: Jesse Nirenberg in his book on Creative Persuasion 
      {2] states that people do too much beating around the bush, and as a 
      result reduce the impact of their message. They tend to give too much 
      background information, leaving the listener confused as to their aim. Dr. 
      Nirenberg suggests that the purpose of your opening remark should be to 
      motivate the other person to continue the discussion. This is best 
      accomplished by getting right to the point and <I>stating your 
      conclusions:</I> "I suggest...." "I would like to see us...." "I'm 
      concerned about...."</P>
      <P>Then <I>state the anticipated benefits</I> of your proposal to the 
      listeners and to the group or the special interests they represent. If you 
      delay in describing the benefits, your audience will use their own 
      imaginations to do so--and their imaginations might be less motivating 
      than yours. Quantify those benefits.</P>
      <P>Then <I>follow with a question</I> to stimulate the listener to react. 
      The listener's reaction then gives you a cue as to what you should say 
      next. Explore the other person's position, if he disagrees or challenges 
      you. Give him more information if he agrees. Don't overload. We all have 
      the tendency to say too much at a time.</P>
      <P>PORTRAY CONFIDENCE: Good speaking is 50% attitude. If you approach a 
      speaking situation with confidence that you will do OK, you most likely 
      will. If, instead, you approach the situation with fear and 
      self-depreciating thoughts ("I'm a poor speaker" or "They are not 
      interested in what I have to say"), you will likely perform under your 
      capability. Your nervousness, your anxiety as a speaker, is rarely as 
      obvious as you think it is. So relax. The object of good speaking is not 
      to remove the butterflies from your stomach, but rather to teach them to 
      fly in formation.</P>
      <P><I>Be enthusiastic. </I>Show people that you believe in and are excited 
      about what you're saying. Unless you have convictions and are willing to 
      express them, you really have nothing to say. Enthusiasm is 
contagious.</P>
      <P><I>Be Yourself. </I>Develop your own unique style. Learn from others, 
      but don't copy them.</P>
      <P>HAVE A SUPPORT GROUP: A support group is one or more persons that you 
      feel comfortable with, that you can rely on for encouragement and 
      suggestions. A support group is formed through mutual consent, with the 
      purpose of giving each other constructive feedback as to how well you do 
      in communicating with others. Communication is a learned skill that comes 
      through practice, learning through experience. A support group can be very 
      helpful in assisting you with that learning experience. Public speaking is 
      a skill that is difficult to perfect on your own. It is difficult to 
      objectively evaluate one's own performance.</P>
      <P>A support group (person) has two objectives: (1) build the speaker's 
      self-confidence and (2) strengthen skills. <I>Self-confidence</I> is 
      developed by giving nonverbal encouragement through smiles, an agreeing 
      nod of the head, or excitement in your eyes, while the person is speaking. 
      Following the presentation, give immediate, sincere feedback as to what 
      the speaker did well. Be specific: "It was particularly effective when 
      you...." Generalities, ("You did a good job") are less helpful. Don't 
      whitewash, with false encouragement.</P>
      <P><I>Skills are strengthened </I>through helpful critique with specific 
      suggestions as to where improvement might be made. This is to be 
      distinguished from the more negative approach of criticizing and pointing 
      out "mistakes."</P>
      <P>In giving feedback: (1) Tell the person in very specific terms what you 
      liked about what she did. Feedback what you perceived as the audience's 
      reaction. Acknowledge progress made over previous presentations.</P>
      <P>(2) Give one, not more than two, specific suggestions for improvement, 
      e.g., "After you made your points, you just stopped and sat down. A two or 
      three sentence summary and restatement of your recommendation might have 
      been more conclusive in leaving your points clearly with the listener." 
      (3) Conclude with an overall statement of positive regard. Don't combine 
      your likes and dislikes into a single statement connected with a "but: "It 
      was a good talk, but..."</P>

      <P align=center><B>SPEECH EVALUATION (3)</B></P>
      <P>The following checklist is provided to help you evaluate yourself and 
      others as a speaker. The most important criteria is overall impact on the 
      listener. Were the speaker's objectives obtained? Were the people being 
      spoken to motivated to action? What distracted from the presentation?</P>
      <P>1. Overall impact of the message on you and the audience.</P>
      <P>2. Content and organization of the message:</P>

      <P>GET A GOOD INTRODUCTION: A much neglected aspect of effective 
      communication is the making of introductions. A good introduction can make 
      a speaker, new member or guest feel great about themselves and the group. 
      Most introductions, unfortunately, are done in a spur of the moment, 
      haphazard manner.</P>
      <P>In introducing a speaker, your objective is to get the audience's 
      attention, to put the speaker at ease, and to set the stage. You are to 
      introduce the <I>topic </I>and <I>purpose</I> of the talk, as well as 
      provide background on the person. Clearly indicate what and why: On 
      <I>what </I>subject will the person be speaking, and <I>why</I> is he or 
      she speaking on that topic. Contact the speaker in advance to get the 
      information you need. In making an introduction, indicate your interest in 
      the person and the topic. Weave the speaker's name into the introduction 
      as much as possible. Be brief. Emphasize the two or three things you 
      personally find most interesting about the person. Illustrate the 
      pertinence of the speaker's subject to the group. Don't provide a 
      pedigree. Once the person has spoken, stand and compliment the person on 
      the presentation. Lead the applause.</P>
      <P>People will become more willing to speak when they receive a supportive 
      introduction, and then complimentary feedback on what was said. 
      Recognition and support are key to the development of speaking skills and 
      confidence.</P>
      <P>PRACTICE: Effective communication can be boiled down to three words. 
      They are practice, practice, practice. Good communicators are so because 
      they work at it. It doesn't just happen. Practice fine tunes our speaking 
      skills, overcomes our fears, raises our comfort level and builds 
      self-confidence.</P>
      <P>A very effective but little used means of practice is <I>mental 
      imagery</I>. Mental imagery involves sitting down in a quiet, comfortable 
      spot, and closing your eyes. Visualize in detail the person(s) you will be 
      speaking to. Visualize yourself delivering your message. Hear yourself 
      speaking the words you plan to use. Visualize yourself as calm, relaxed 
      and confident, with good eye contact and rapport with the audience. 
      Visualize every detail of your presentation. Anticipate different 
      problems, such as losing your train of thought; anticipate likely 
      questions; anticipate different audience responses. Then think through how 
      you would handle each. Clearly visualize yourself as poised and 
      effective--a success.</P>
      <P>A community resource that can be very helpful in improving your 
      communication and public speaking skills is membership in a Toastmasters 
      Club. Toastmasters also offers an excellent eight-part educational program 
      called Speech craft, that is available to community groups. Toastmasters 
      develops speaking skills and confidence in a fun, non-threatening, 
      supportive atmosphere.[4]</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE:</P>
      <P>Prepare and deliver a short speech. Practice it until it is smooth. Get 
      a colleague (or a support group) to evaluate you using the speech 
      evaluation above.
