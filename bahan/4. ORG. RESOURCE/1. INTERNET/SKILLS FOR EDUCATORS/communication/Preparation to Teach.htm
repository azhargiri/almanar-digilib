      <H2>Preparation to Teach C-6</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Exercise makes the master.</I> </P>
      <P>Periodically, we all are called upon to teach, to present an 
      educational message. It might be as a church school teacher, a 4-H leader, 
      a presenter of information to a group, a helper to a friend, or a parent. 
      Our effectiveness as a "teacher" is based in the communication skills 
      covered in module C-1. This section will build on those skills.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES:</P>
      <P>1. Gain insight into how people learn.<BR>2. Use the five steps to 
      effective teaching.<BR>3. Prepare and use visual aids.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>HOW PEOPLE LEARN</H3>
      <P>Considerable research has been done on how children and adults learn. 
      The following principles can help you create an environment which will 
      facilitate learning.</P>
      <P>People learn best when they are active and involved in the learning 
      process. People generally remember:</P>
      <P>10% of what they read<BR>20% of what they hear<BR>30% of what they hear 
      and read<BR>50% of what they hear and see<BR>70% of what they say or 
      write<BR>90% of what they do[1]</P>
      <P>Learning is a consequence of experience. The giving of information 
      alone is not enough for learning to occur. Learning must be used to be 
      retained. Group discussion and practice exercises are seven to ten times 
      more effective in changing attitudes and behavior than a lecture.[2]</P>
      <P>Learning occurs only when what is being taught has personal <I>meaning 
      and importance</I> to the individual. The individual must feel a need, for 
      learning to occur. People do not change their behavior merely because 
      someone tells them to do so or tells them how to do so. Educators can 
      increase their effectiveness by assessing the needs, problems, interests 
      and competencies of prospective participants, and then tailoring the 
      educational experience to those needs and interests. Involve the learner 
      in setting educational objectives. Interview (pre-test) participants to 
      determine their present competencies in the subjects to be covered. Since 
      the needs, interests and abilities of individuals vary, a cafeteria style 
      of teaching, where different levels and approaches are offered, is often 
      necessary.</P>
      <P>Learning is a <I>cooperative and collaborative process</I> in which 
      participants are teachers as well as learners (and vise versa). This is 
      particularly true in adult learning. Adults have a broad base of 
      experience upon which to draw and to share with others. View yourself as a 
      facilitator of learning rather than as the expert.[1] The appropriate 
      "answer" lies within the learner, not the teacher. People learn more 
      quickly if learning is based on their experiences. Each individual has an 
      accumulation of experiences, ideas, feelings and attitudes which comprise 
      a rich vein of material for problem-solving and learning.[3]</P>
      <P>Learning occurs in <I>an accepting atmosphere</I>, where different 
      ideas and opinions are valued. (Acceptance does not, however, need to 
      imply agreement.) Learning is facilitated in an atmosphere which 
      recognizes people's right to make mistakes.</P>
      <P>Learning is facilitated in an atmosphere of mutual respect, where 
      participants are encouraged to open up and to share with one another. It 
      is paradoxical that the more we try to change people the more they resist. 
      Only until people feel accepted and respected for who they are and no 
      longer have to defend themselves and their values are they free to look at 
      themselves, to learn, and to change. Behavioral change requires time and 
      patience.[3] Individuals must be free to progress at their own rate and in 
      their own way. Help people feel comfortable in the learning process.</P>
      <P>Learning is facilitated through <I>encouragement</I> and the 
      development of <I>positive self esteem</I>. A major block to learning is a 
      negative self image. Self-image is reinforced by the support or lack of 
      support received in the home. Value the person. Exhibit positive attitudes 
      of warmth, caring, interest and respect. Give frequent praise and 
      recognition.</P>
      <P>In working with young people, their age and stage of development 
      greatly influence how they learn and what is of interest to them. Teaching 
      methods must be <I>adapted to the physical, mental, social and emotional 
      capabilities of the age group(s) </I>you are working with. Module P-1 on 
      the growth and development of youth [7] introduces these developmental 
      characteristics, for ages 0 to 18. you need insights into what you can 
      expect from different age groups, and how to work with them.</P>
      <P>With reference to adults, research indicates that speed of performance 
      and reaction time tend to decline with age. This explains the slower rate 
      of learning among adults, but does not mean their ability to learn is 
      less. Adults learn best when they are able to set their own pace.[2]</P>
      <P>While research indicates that the basic ability to learn remains 
      essentially unimpaired throughout our adult life span, it is our attitude 
      toward learning that appears to change. There are times when the readiness 
      to learn is greater than at other times. In early adulthood, ages 18-30, 
      learning is focused on selecting a mate, rearing children, starting an 
      occupation, managing a home. At middle age, 30-55, learning is focused on 
      civic and social responsibilities, coping with teenagers, leisure time 
      activities, adjusting to aging parents. In later years, 55 and over, 
      learning is focused on decreasing physical strength, retirement and 
      reduced income, adjusting to the illness or death of a spouse or friend. 
      Adulthood has its transition points and its crises--aging, divorce, child 
      rearing, death, career development, etc.-- in almost as complete a sense 
      as there are developmental stages for children and adolescents.[4] A good 
      educator conducts programs that are age appropriate.</P>
      <P>Adults differ from children in that adult education often involves some 
      amount of unlearning. Learning then can be painful, as we give up old and 
      comfortable ways of believing, thinking and valuing. Learning involves 
      dealing with feelings as well as facts. The educator who tries to separate 
      the two will not be effective. Module E-2 discusses adult education in 
      greater depth.</P>
      <P>Content is more easily grasped when learning experiences are 
      sequentially ordered and integrated. Each successive step should build on 
      the previous one. New material should be related to what is already known. 
      Instruction presented in logical units, with objectives and time 
      parameters clearly stated, results in the most effective learning. [2]</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>THE FIVE STEPS OF TEACHING [5]</H3>
      <P><B>Step 1: Prepare</B></P>
      <P>Assess the needs and interests of the prospective learner. What is 
      their present level of knowledge and experience on the subject? What do 
      they hope to get out of this? Outline what you wish to cover, and how you 
      plan to cover it. What teaching methods do you intend to use? How will 
      participants be involved in this learning? How will your time be 
      budgeted?</P>
      <P><B>Step 2: Set the stage</B></P>
      <P>Put people at ease. Use a warm-up exercise to get everyone acquainted 
      with one another. For example, have participants pair up, and spend five 
      minutes telling each other about themselves, and what brought them to the 
      session. Now call on each person in turn to introduce his/her partner to 
      the group. Limit introductions to 30 seconds, to include the two or three 
      things each found most interesting about the partner. An alternative would 
      be to call on each person in turn to share expectations for the session 
      --"What do you hope to gain from this workshop?" List these expectations 
      on newsprint or a blackboard.</P>
      <P>The tone of involvement is set at the beginning. If people come in and 
      are lectured to, they will expect to be passive learners for the entire 
      program. Clarify to the group your objectives, the format and teaching 
      methods you intend to use, your expectations of the group, and the time 
      schedule. Relate your subject to their specific needs and interests. Get 
      them interested in learning more.</P>
      <P><B>Step 3: Present Ideas</B></P>
      <P>Tell, show, illustrate, explain, demonstrate. Proceed step-by-step from 
      the simple to the complex, from the known to the unknown. Relate the 
      material to their experiences. Teach in small doses. The human brain is 
      only capable of absorbing about four seconds of talk at one time. Then a 
      pause is required--a second or two to allow the brain to soak up what was 
      said. Four seconds of talk is 12 to 15 words. A multitude of facts and 
      ideas presented too close together can cause confusion. Keep to key 
      points.[5]</P>
      <P>Groups will listen to someone without fidgeting for only a short time, 
      usually 10 to 20 minutes. Alternate short presentations with discussion 
      and practice exercises.</P>
      <P><B>Step 4: Check and Question</B></P>
      <P>Learning is a two-way process. Plan time for reflection and discussion. 
      Encourage people to ask questions, to share experience, and to internalize 
      the material. Get feedback. Encourage discussion by asking open-ended 
      questions, questions that begin with the words why, what, which and how 
      (i.e., "What has been your experience with.....?"). Avoid closed-ended 
      questions ("Is this clear?") that can be answered with a simple yes or 
      no.</P>
      <P>Use role playing and work exercises to practice the techniques taught, 
      and give you feedback as to how well they are understood. Remember, 
      learning must be used to be retained.</P>
      <P><B>Step 5: Summarize and Evaluate</B></P>
      <P>Summarize your key points. Challenge participants to action. Indicate 
      where additional information and assistance can be obtained.</P>
      <P>Evaluate. Go around the room and have each person reflect on what they 
      have gained and the actions they intend to take as a result of this 
      training. What other information and training do they desire?</P>
      <P>Plan for an evaluation midway through the training session, to get 
      feedback on how things are going. Are expectations being met? What 
      adjustments could be made to improve the session? Participants must 
      realize that they are as responsible for the success of the training 
      session as you are.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>VISUAL AIDS</H3>
      <P>Eighty-three percent of what we learn comes through our sense of sight. 
      In one experiment, the same educational material was presented to two 
      different audiences. One lecture was supported by visual aids, the other 
      was not. A test was given three hours after the lecture. The audience 
      shown visuals scored 85% versus 70% for the other audience. Ten days after 
      the lecture, the two groups were tested again. The group that had seen 
      visuals recalled 65% of the material, while the group that hadn't could 
      recall only 10%. Visuals, then, increase long-term recall and retention. 
      [6]</P>
      <P>Some of the various visual aids from which to choose include:</P>
      <P>--chalkboard<BR>--posters<BR>--models<BR>--hand-outs<BR>--slides<BR>--video<BR>--role 
      plays.</P>
      <P>In using a <I>chalkboard, posters or flip chart,</I> use bold block 
      lettering 2" to 3" high. Alternate colors for contrast. Include no more 
      than eight lines, 25 words, per visual. Prepare your visuals beforehand. 
      Use a yard stick to keep lines straight. Include simple drawings. Posters, 
      etc., are particularly useful in outlining your key points and in 
      presenting tables, charts and graphs.</P>
      <P><I>Models </I>refer to the use of objects to demonstrate how something 
      is done. Many topics, such as sharpening a knife or pruning an apple tree, 
      are much easier demonstrated than described. Such objects should be large 
      enough for everyone to see. If not, divide into smaller groups for close 
      up inspection.</P>
      <P>The <I>hand-out</I> is a written message used to supplement a verbal 
      presentation. The hand-out can provide more detailed instruction, 
      illustration or a checklist for later use by the participant in putting 
      the material to use. A hand-out can also be used as an outline or 
      listening guide to focus audience attention and encourage note taking.</P>
      <P>Hand-outs are more likely to be read if they are visually attractive. 
      Simple line drawings, clip art, cartoons and other illustrations make the 
      hand-out more inviting to the reader. Material printed in two 3 1/2 inch 
      columns rather than across the entire page is considered by many easier to 
      read. Use wide margins and plan white spaces of variable sizes to reduce 
      monotony. Crowding the page with information can discourage the 
reader.</P>
      <P>Generally you should not distribute hand-outs before a talk--unless it 
      includes information to be referred to in your presentation that is 
      necessary for understanding. If people try to read the hand-out during 
      your presentation, it will distract from your message.</P>
      <P><I>Slides, video and other projected visuals</I> have the advantage of 
      being able to show the actual people, places and things you wish to talk 
      about. These images are projected in familiar, natural color. Tables, 
      charts and typed messages can also be prepared to be interspersed with 
      pictures. Pace your presentation to give adequate time to comprehend the 
      picture and read any message.</P>
      <P>Educational films, slide programs and videos are available on many 
      topics. They can be acquired on loan from libraries and other educational 
      institutions and commercial outlets to supplement your presentation.</P>
      <P>A disadvantage of most projected visuals is that the room must be 
      darkened for their use, thus losing important eye contact with the 
      audience. Projected visuals encourage a passive audience response. This 
      can be overcome by interspersing projected visuals with group discussion 
      and other audience participation exercises.</P>
      <P><I>Role Playing </I>involves the acting out of a situation in order to 
      demonstrate the use of a particular technique or skill. Role playing can 
      be used to model good (and bad) examples of the techniques or skills being 
      taught. Role playing is particularly effective in demonstrating skills in 
      interpersonal relations (how to say "no" to a request). To model a 
      technique, write your script before hand, practice and then present it 
      with the help of a friend. People will retain information longer when they 
      have the opportunity to see it in action.</P>
      <P>Role plays can also be used to give participants the opportunity to 
      practice the techniques being taught, in applying them to real life 
      situations. By trying out the prescribed techniques, participants become 
      more comfortable and confident in their use. Such role plays increase 
      participation and stimulate discussion. Role plays give you feedback as to 
      how well the techniques being taught are understood.</P>
      <P>In developing a role play for classroom use, write up a brief situation 
      statement. Keep it simple. For example, your daughter is pressuring you to 
      baby sit your grandson, while she is at work. "Mom (Dad) you are my last 
      hope. This is important to me, and I can't find anyone else." You are 
      willing to help out in emergency situations, but not on a regular basis. 
      You have other things you'd rather do during this time in your life. Tell 
      your daughter "no", using the four steps prescribed in the hand-out.</P>
      <P>Call on a participant, present the situation and ask him or her to 
      respond, speaking directly to you or an assigned partner. Once the 
      situation has been role played, ask the group to comment on what they 
      liked about how the situation was handled, and then where improvements 
      might be made. Be prepared with examples. Some people will be more 
      comfortable with role playing than others. Be patient and supportive; 
      emphasize that the role playing provides a valuable learning 
      opportunity.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the use of visuals can greatly increase learner 
      retention. Unfortunately, they are rarely used. Common excuses for not 
      using visuals are: I'm not artistic. My handwriting is terrible. I'm not 
      an actor. I don't have the time. It doesn't make a difference. These are 
      cop outs. Experience shows that visuals do not have to be "artistic" and 
      "professional" to be effective. Your objective is to have people remember 
      your message, not your visual.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE 1:</P>
      <P>Ask each person in the study group to stand and briefly reflect on 
      her/his experience, difficulties and successes in speaking before a group. 
      After everyone has spoken, ask the group as a whole to make a list of 
      things they each could do to support and help each other in strengthening 
      their speaking skills and confidence.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE 2:</P>
      <P>Recall times when you were a student, first as a child and then as an 
      adult. Focus on a favorite teacher. Then recall a memorable learning 
      experience you have had as an adult. Now focus on a less effective 
      learning experience. Why was one teacher or learning experience more 
      effective than another? What factors contributed to your learning? List 
      those factors in the space below. (If time permits, have each person share 
      her/his list with the group.)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE 3:</P>
      <P>(Optional) Prepare a five minute demonstration or educational message 
      on a topic of your choosing. Keep it simple.</P>
      <P>At the study group meeting, call on each person, in turn, to deliver 
      his/her prepared presentation. Assign an "evaluator" to each presenter. 
      Following each presentation, call on the evaluator for feedback as to what 
      was done well, plus one or two suggestions for improvement. (Review module 
      C-3 for guidelines in being an evaluator/support group.)</P>
