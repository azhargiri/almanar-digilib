      <H2>Motivation V-4</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Interest has feet. When people are really interested in 
      something, they find a way.</I> </P>
      <P>Getting people to volunteer is one thing, but getting them to follow 
      through in carrying out the decision of the group is another. How do you 
      inspire people to action, and then keep them motivated? This section is 
      about how to get things done working with and through others. Motivation 
      of people in volunteer groups is different than motivating students in 
      schools or employees in business.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After completing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Be aware of common barriers to participation, and how to remove 
      them.<BR>2. Describe how to motivate volunteers.<BR>3. Describe how to 
      successfully delegate a responsibility to a volunteer.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION</B></P>
      <P>Forget about trying to recruit and motivate people until you first 
      learn how to stop chasing them away. What are you now doing that 
      discourages people from participating more actively in your group or 
      cause? We need to recognize the costs as well as the benefits 
      (disincentives as well as incentives) to participating in any activity or 
      organization. People make choices as to what groups and activities they 
      become involved in, and how much time they give to each, based on their 
      perception of these costs and benefits. They consciously, and 
      unconsciously, weigh one against the other. If the perceived costs 
      outweigh the perceived benefits, they drop out of the group or become less 
      active. These costs then become barriers to participation.</P>
      <P>These costs include not only monetary outlays for travel, baby sitters, 
      dues, etc., but also time, effort, and the giving up of other activities 
      (e.g. missing your favorite TV show). Other costs include social and 
      psychological costs such as the risk of embarrassment, having to sit 
      through boring meetings, criticism and rejection of your ideas, being 
      imposed upon by others, ridicule, and feelings of inadequacy. Other 
      barriers to participation include the lack of clear goals (an unclear 
      sense of group purpose), failure to recognize individuals for what they 
      have contributed, a pessimistic group atmosphere (with much complaining 
      and criticizing), weak or autocratic leadership, not feeling listened to, 
      being given too many responsibilities too soon, and the lack of group 
      accomplishment.</P>
      <P>Such experiences constitute very real costs, and people will not accept 
      such costs unless they perceive sufficient benefits to make it worthwhile. 
      These benefits are social and psychological (e.g., prestige, fellowship, 
      sense of accomplishment, recognition, feeling good about oneself) as well 
      as economic. A group motivates participation in the same way a business 
      generates sales, by offering something people want at a reasonable cost. 
      Participation can be increased by reducing costs and removing barriers as 
      well as by increasing benefits.</P>
      <P><I>What can be done to reduce the costs of participation?</I></P>
      <P>Some of the costs of participation are inevitable and unavoidable, such 
      as dealing with differences of opinion, uncertainty of the future, 
      unpredictability of people and taking responsibility for decisions made. 
      These costs are best relieved through mutual support and 
understanding.</P>
      <P>Other costs, particularly those resulting from interpersonal strife, 
      can be avoided or reduced by exhibiting behavior which is more accepting, 
      supporting, encouraging and rewarding than it is ignoring, rejecting, and 
      coercing. Help others feel secure within the group so they can focus their 
      energy on the work to be done rather than upon their personal insecurities 
      or the possibility of rejection by others.</P>
      <P>Still other costs are more perceived than real. They are primarily the 
      result of an individual's fears. Help the person acknowledge those fears, 
      and talk them out. Don't be critical of them, or minimize the problem. 
      Don't give hasty reassurance and pat solutions. The fearful person needs 
      empathy more than advice.</P>
      <P>So far, we've looked at potential barriers to participation--things you 
      may be doing, often unintentionally, that discourage people from becoming 
      more active. Motivation begins with identifying and removing such 
      barriers. Let's now turn our attention to the positive motivation of 
      people, and the actions each of us can take to encourage and motivate 
      others.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE?</B></P>
      <P>How do you get people to serve? How do you get turn-out at meetings? 
      How do you get people to pitch in and help? How do you recruit good 
      volunteer workers? How do you raise money to support an organization?</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge the obvious, that people become involved in 
      different issues, activities and groups ONLY to the extent that their 
      personal needs and interests are appealed to and met. In short, 
      individuals must perceive a reason for becoming involved. They, not you, 
      must perceive that reason. In our zeal, we often get carried away with 
      what we think should be done, and fail to give adequate attention to the 
      concerns and interests of others. We tell ourselves, "but they SHOULD be 
      interested, after all it affects the whole community" or "they OUGHT to 
      support this, it's for their own good." We label people as "apathetic" who 
      don't have the same interests we have.</P>
      <P>We each have different concerns, needs and interests. We each have our 
      own priorities. You motivate group participation by focusing attention on 
      areas of common concern and interest. Group participation and commitment 
      cannot be forced through hard sell or majority vote. The persons being 
      recruited must feel that the proposed action will result in something 
      meaningful to them and that the effort required is worth it.</P>
      <P>How do you find out what people's priority concerns and interests are? 
      How do you find out what motivates them? By listening, and by asking. 
      People naturally talk about what they're interested in, if we'll just 
      listen. Effective recruitment requires listening, more than telling.</P>
      <P>In understanding what motivates people, we need to acknowledge that 
      people's needs and interests go beyond the "selfish" motives of what will 
      benefit their business or their lifestyle or their prestige and influence 
      in the community. Harold Kushner in his best seller "When All You've Ever 
      Wanted Isn't Enough: The Search for a Life That Matters," finds that "the 
      key to happiness is the opportunity to use our special abilities, to be 
      appreciated for them......and to make a difference. People today are doing 
      an increasing amount of volunteer work, he says, because they are not 
      getting those three basic needs fulfilled through their eight-to-five 
      jobs. Thus we motivate people to serve by appealing to their altruistic 
      sense as well as personal needs and interests.</P>
      <P>A review of the research of Frederick Herzberg, on what motivates 
      people in the work setting, indicates that the leading motivators are:</P>
      <P>1. Achievement (accomplishment and a sense of contribution)<BR>2. 
      Recognition (support, praise, respect)<BR>3. The work itself (meaningful, 
      stimulating, fulfilling)<BR>4. Responsibility (and advancement)<BR>5. 
      Creativity and growth (learning; giving of oneself to others)<BR>6. 
      Economic benefits (reward; pay check, profit)<BR>7. Companionship 
      (acceptance, a sense of belonging)<BR>8. Supervision (rules and 
      policy)<BR>9 Working conditions (comfort)</P>
      <P>Those factors at the top of the list (1 to 5) are what motivate people 
      to strive, to excel, to commit and to feel good about themselves. The 
      factors at the bottom of the list (6 to 9) are more potential sources of 
      dissatisfaction than they are motivators. Lack of these can make us 
      unhappy, but they have limited impact in inspiring us to excel. You 
      motivate others by providing items 1 through 5.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>THE BASICS OF PEOPLE MANAGEMENT</B></P>
      <P>With the above introduction to human motivation, let's now look at how 
      each of us can become a more effective people manager--in getting things 
      done, working with and through others. Five keys to effective people 
      management are outlined below. [1]</P>
      <P><I>1. Set goals and clarify objectives</I></P>
      <P>A clear sense of direction is essential to individual and group 
      achievement. Without it, people tend to wander in their efforts, with 
      limited accomplishment. A good people manager helps the individual or 
      group clarify their objectives in specific, concrete, realistic terms. 
      What is to be the end result, and how is it to be accomplished? Who is to 
      do what by when? Who is responsible? Is there agreement?</P>
      <P>To be a motivating force, goals must reflect the personal interests and 
      commitment of the individuals involved. Commitment comes out of 
      involvement--of people deciding for themselves, rather than having it 
      decided for them. Rarely do people get as excited about others' ideas as 
      they do about their own ideas. A good people manager knows how to help a 
      group identify, common concerns and interests, and to build on them. (For 
      more information on the goal setting process, see module E-6.)</P>
      <P>Once goals are set, periodically take "one minute" to review and 
      clarify those goals/objectives with the individual(s) responsible. Keep in 
      touch. Check their progress. Let them know you care.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, if your group lacks enthusiasm, it is likely due to 
      either:</P>
      <P>(1) The lack of clear understanding within the group as to what your 
      goals and objectives are (in other words, you haven't done enough goal 
      setting), or (2) Group goals/objectives are not seen as personally 
      important to many of the individuals involved (in other words, members 
      weren't really involved in setting those goals), or (3) The individuals 
      involved fail to see how group activities contribute to the agreed upon 
      goals (in other words, you've lost sight of your objectives).</P>
      <P><I>2. Give frequent recognition</I></P>
      <P>To be appreciated, to feel important and needed is a basic human need. 
      Encouragement and recognition are essential to human development and 
      motivation. Module V-8 gives specific suggestions for recognition. Review 
      that module now or at the end of this module.</P>
      <P><I>3. Take Time To Listen</I></P>
      <P>People are not going to open up to you until they first feel accepted. 
      See module C-2 for a discussion of how to listen.</P>
      <P><I>4. Speak Up For Yourself</I></P>
      <P>Most people view motivation as a form of persuasion. We see motivators 
      as smooth talking salespeople who can persuade others to their point of 
      view; who know how to twist an arm in getting their way.</P>
      <P>Motivation, however, is as much or more a function of active listening 
      as it is of persuasion. Motivation is not something that can be imposed on 
      others. It rather is something that must come from within the individual. 
      We motivate others only to the extent that we appeal to their personal 
      needs and interests.</P>
      <P>Being a good people manager/motivator does, however, require being able 
      to speak up for yourself, in sharing your interests, goals and concerns 
      with others. (Module C-3 deals with this topic in more depth.)</P>
      <P><I>5. Confront Unacceptable Behavior </I></P>
      <P>There are times when confrontation is necessary to work out problems 
      and rekindle initiative. Blanchard and Johnson in their book The One 
      Minute Manager [2] speak of "one minute reprimands." How then do you give 
      constructive criticism and work out problems--in a manner that encourages 
      rather than discourages the other person?</P>
      <P>One option in dealing with unsatisfactory performance is to <I>let it 
      pass, and forget it</I>. Letting it pass is particularly appropriate when 
      your disapproval is primarily based on a value judgment as to how you feel 
      the job should be performed, rather than on results.</P>
      <P>If, however, you are not willing and able to drop it and forget it, 
      then letting it pass is not appropriate. If you harbor resentment, it 
      won't help the relationship. Instead, confront: <I>Do it now.</I> Talk 
      with the person as soon as possible following the unacceptable behavior or 
      work. The longer you wait after the fact, the less helpful it will be. 
      <I>Don't gunnysack</I>. Don't save up wrong doings for later 
      confrontation. Keep to the here and now.</P>
      <P>Confront the person <I>privately, face to face</I>, never publicly. 
      Express your concern in a direct, but caring manner through the use of an 
      I-Statement. "I'm concerned with...." "I am confused by...." "I'd like to 
      talk to you about...." "I've observed...." Avoid accusatory 
      You-statements: "You should have...." "You didn't...." "Why did you 
      ...?"</P>
      <P><I>Describe the problem behavior,</I> and its impact on you and/or 
      others. Be specific; don't generalize. Describe behavior that can be 
      changed. Trying to change people's values (personality) is difficult, if 
      not impossible. Focus on facts, without making judgments. "I'm concerned 
      about your tardiness. You have been over 15 minutes late three mornings 
      this week." "I was confused and frustrated by the poor attendance at our 
      planning meeting last week. As an officer, I find it difficult to plan 
      activities when I am not sure what members want." "I feel uncomfortable 
      when someone makes jokes during our meetings. I feel they distract from 
      the discussion and may cause members to treat lightly the suggestions 
      (information) being presented."</P>
      <P><I>Don't judge</I>, analyze or parent the other person. ("You're always 
      late." "You never...." "You're inconsiderate." "Set your alarm earlier." 
      "You should have known better." "You're doing this because....") The more 
      accusations you make, the more resistance you'll get. Instead, focus on 
      the specifics of the unacceptable behavior and its impact on you and 
      others.</P>
      <P><I>Stop, be silent.</I> Let it sink in. Allow the person time to focus 
      on what you've said, and to respond, clarify, question, or suggest 
      possible remedies. Listen, and show it. Probe for further clarification, 
      "I'm not clear on.....Tell me more about....."</P>
      <P>Counter any defensive response with <I>reflective listening</I>. 
      Summarize back in your own words your understanding of the person's 
      explanation and feelings. Don't dispute them. Reflective listening 
      acknowledges and helps dissipate the emotions involved.</P>
      <P>If necessary, <I>adjust or repeat your concern. </I>Adjust your concern 
      based on the information gained. OR Repeat it. Don't get sidetracked into 
      an argument over who is right. <I>Don't tack on more accusations or 
      evidence.</I> Avoid heating up the criticism. Instead, calmly repeat your 
      concern or request, then try to better understand what happened. "In the 
      future, I do however wish to start our meetings on time."</P>
      <P><I>Encourage collaborative problem-solving.</I> "How can we resolve 
      this?" "I'd like your help in working this out." "Could we find a solution 
      that would be agreeable to both of us?" "Would it be acceptable to you if 
      we...?"</P>
      <P>Summarize the discussion and the solution you've worked out.</P>
      <P>Clearly remind the person that you value him or her. <I>Give non-verbal 
      reinforcement</I>--a hand shake, an appropriate touch, supportive facial 
      expressions. Thank the person for being frank and cooperative.</P>
      <P>Your objective is to communicate openly, to improve the situation, to 
      build self esteem and strengthen the relationship. It is not to punish or 
      put the person in her/his place. (See Chapter 9, "Working Out Differences" 
      for more on conflict management.)</P>

      <P>EXERCISES</P>
      <P><I>Exercise 1:</I></P>
      <P>a. Why DO people join groups? Why are you active in different 
      activities?</P>
      <P>Use the space below to indicate what motivated you to become involved 
      in different community activities and groups. Why are you more active in 
      some groups (activities) than in others?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>If you are in a study group, share your lists with each other.</P>
      <P>b. Why DON'T people become more involved in different community 
      activities? What causes people to drop out and become inactive?</P>
      <P>Use the space below to indicate why you chose not to participate in 
      certain activities or groups in your community. Have you ever lost 
      interest in a group (or activity) and as a result dropped out or became 
      less active? Why did that happen?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>If you are in a study group, share your lists with each other. Then ask 
      participants to comment on what they have learned through this exercise, 
      part a and b. (A common reason given for not participating is "don't have 
      the time." Yet people find time to do what they want to do. "Not having 
      time" means the activity is not perceived as providing the benefits, over 
      costs, of other activities.)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><I>Exercise 2:</I></P>
      <P>List in the space below what you feel are the qualifications of a good 
      leader (people manager). Think of people you've worked for or with in the 
      past (paid employment as well as volunteer work). Some people were better 
      to work for than others. Why? What were the traits they exhibited that 
      motivated you to give more of yourself?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>If you are in a study group, break into small groups of 5-7. Share your 
      experiences with the group and develop a composite list. Encourage 
      discussion.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><I>Exercise 3:</I></P>
      <P>Focus on a group in which you are now active:</P>
      <P>__________________________________ (name of group)</P>
      <P>Review the discussion of barriers to participation (the first two pages 
      of this chapter). Then take a close look at your meetings and how the 
      group functions. Make a list below of individual and group behaviors that 
      may be negative motivators (they discourage rather than encourage 
      participation and follow-through). Then identify actions that might be 
      taken to reduce those inhibitors. (This exercise can be completed as 
      either an individual or study group endeavor.)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>a. Possible inhibitors to participation. b. What can be done to reduce 
      those inhibitors?</P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>DELEGATION</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The preceding principles are also key to your success in delegating 
      tasks to others. Special care should be taken to:</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>1. Delegate the right tasks, namely anything for which you have no 
      unique competence. Be specific in what you delegate to others. Don't 
      delegate if you want the credit.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>2. Delegate to the right person(s). Consider the individual's special 
      knowledge, interests, relevant experience, and motivation to do the job. 
      Match the person's abilities and interests with the needs of the job. 
      Giving a person more responsibility will generally increase job 
      satisfaction- -if such responsibility is seen by the person as both 
      challenging and within his or her own capabilities.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>3. Help the person succeed by sharing as much information, background 
      and "other considerations" as you can. Clearly indicate your expectations. 
      Then let go. Requiring the person to check everything with you before 
      taking action is not delegating. If you can't let go, do it yourself.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>4. Delegate and follow-up. Get briefed on progress but do not pester.
