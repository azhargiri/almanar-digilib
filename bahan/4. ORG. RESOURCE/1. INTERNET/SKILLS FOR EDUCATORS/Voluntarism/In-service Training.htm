      <P align=center>Practice makes perfect, if you practice the right thing in 
      the right way.</P></I> 
      <P>Before starting this module, review the module on orientation 
(V-5).</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe three basic training approaches.<BR>2. Design a training 
      program.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>APPROACHES TO TRAINING</H3>
      <P>Training is often approached within the unique context of service 
      industries. Hence, highly successful training programs are commonly found 
      within the context of clerical, vocational, teacher, medical, and a host 
      of professional and technical areas. Individuals who plan and deliver 
      training consider the level of expertise or competency of the employees to 
      be trained. Kenney (1972) discusses office training for selling, craft 
      training, technician training, technologist training, and management 
      training. DePhillips (1960) links training to various kinds of learning 
      such as sensory-motor, conceptual, attitudinal, and associational 
      learning. Wight and Hammons (1970) discuss the traditional as well as the 
      experienced-based approach while Elam (1971) distinguishes between 
      experience-based and performance-based training.</P>
      <P>From these approaches to training, a typology can be constructed that 
      is relevant to nonformal educational settings. These are traditional 
      training, experiential training, and performance-based training. An 
      understanding of each approach will enable extension workers and farmers 
      to choose the best approach.</P>
      <P><B>Traditional Approach to Training</B></P>
      <P align=left>DePhillips (1960) and Kenney (1972) describe a traditional 
      training model wherein the focus is on intervention by the training staff. 
      Figure 1 illustrates the traditional model of training. In this model, the 
      training staff determines the objectives, content, techniques, 
      assignments, how learners will be motivated, and how they will be 
      evaluated. Individuals who use this model often find that learners assume 
      passive roles. This model creates a setting which resembles a formal 
      classroom. Most of the training is instructor-oriented. The instructor 
      decides what learners need to know, selects the content or the subject 
      matter areas, writes the lesson plans, and then serves as the chief 
      purveyor of the information. The instructor is clearly the focus in the 
      traditional model of training because this person is to perform while the 
      learners are to listen, observe, and perhaps imitate the instructor's 
      behaviors. </P>

      <P align=center>Figure 1. Traditional Model of Training</P>
      <P>According to Rao and Hanumanthappa (1985), traditional methods of 
      imparting knowledge, efforts to change attitudes, and structured courses 
      that are supposedly guaranteed to solve problems, do not always bring 
      about the desired behavioral change in trainees. Further, these authors 
      suggest that experiential training which (1) uses adequate methods of 
      training, (2) includes feedback systems, and (3) adapts experimental 
      concepts to learning can be effective in bringing about desirable 
      behavioral changes in trainees. An examination of the experiential 
      training approach merits further discussion.</P>
      <P><B>Experiential Approach to Training</B></P>
      <P>Experiential training incorporates experiences wherein the learner 
      becomes active and influences the training process. As opposed to the 
      academic approach inherent in the traditional model, experiential training 
      emphasizes immersion into real or simulated situations in which the 
      trainee is eventually to operate. In this model, objectives are determined 
      collectively by trainers and trainees who (1) identify problems and 
      resources, (2) explore and evaluate alternative solutions to problems, and 
      (3) reflect on and conceptualize the total experience. Trainers are 
      responsible for structuring a training process in which trainees can 
      internalize skills, knowledge and attitudes for use after the training 
      program is terminated. Figure 2 presents a schematic conceptualization of 
      the experiential training model.</P>
      <P>In experiential training, the trainer serves primarily as a 
      facilitator, catalyst, and resource person. This individual (1) provides 
      the rules and structure, (2) helps trainees develop the skills and 
      understanding to perform effectively, and (3) works with all trainees to 
      help them continuously improve their performance. The trainer emphasizes 
      cooperation and teamwork so that all team members can assist in the 
      development of each individual. Such a collegial and supportive approach 
      enhances teamwork.</P>

      <P>...Step 1</P>
      <P><B>Performance-based Approach to Training</B></P>
      <P>In the third approach to training, performance-based goals are 
      specified. The trainee is accountable not for achieving passing grades, 
      but for attaining a given level of proficiency. Emphasis is placed on a 
      specific skill that is observable while the trainee performs essential 
      tasks. This approach to training is task- or skill-centered and stresses 
      practical skills and knowledge that can be used in work or community 
      settings.</P>
      <P>The performance-based teacher education (PBTE) model developed by Elam 
      (1971) is also applicable to nonformal educational organizations. The 
      implied characteristics of this model include individualization, feedback, 
      systematic programming, and learner and program accountability. In 
      addition, some related and desirable characteristics of the model include 
      its field setting, broad base for decision making and training materials, 
      learner participation in decision making, and research orientation. Elam's 
      model employs methods which are relatively flexible and allow learners to 
      progress at their own rate with many alternatives and options.</P>
      <P>The model emphasizes specific skill training as well as attention to 
      knowledge and attitudes of trainees. In addition, the model provides for 
      congruence between objectives and evidence used for evaluative purposes. 
      The PBTE model enables participants to be active learners whose viewpoints 
      are important in shaping the educational activity. To be used effectively, 
      PBTE's research orientation must be adapted to field situations. In 
      addition, special attention will be required to orient the training toward 
      the use of scarce local resources, a problem in many areas of the world. 
      Consideration should be given to having participants bear some of the 
      costs of the training. Not only will this policy help overcome training 
      costs, it will also help make the training (1) oriented to local 
      conditions and (2) responsive to learners' needs.</P>
      <P>In designing an educational solution for a particular situation, 
      components from various training approaches might be used. Elements of the 
      experiential as well as performance-based approach that are appropriate to 
      the training needs of extension personnel and farmers should be used. The 
      traditional training approach should be used sparingly and carefully.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P><B>
      <P align=center>SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRAINING FARMERS IN OTHER 
      COUNTRIES<BR></B>(or other special groups) </P>
      <P>Farmers are more interested in agricultural production and improving 
      the quality of their lives. Training for farmers, however, should take 
      account of their particular needs. Below are some considerations for 
      trainers who are developing a training program for farmers.</P>
      <P><B>Matching the literacy level of farmers</B></P>
      <P>Current literature indicates that a majority of farmers worldwide do 
      not have a basic minimum education. Therefore all training provided for 
      this special group must be carefully matched to their literacy levels. 
      Appropriate media and methods should be selected. Clear and simple 
      explanations should be given. Visits to demonstration plots, tours, 
      demonstrations, and discussions are just a few of the variety of methods 
      that will help farmers to see the value of the training and to apply it to 
      their own needs.</P>
      <P><B>Matching the demographics of farmers</B></P>
      <P>Demographic factors such as age, ownership of land, education, previous 
      participation in similar programs, previous contacts, wealth, and 
      availability of resources are associated with the adoption of improved 
      practices. An understanding of these factors helps improve the 
      effectiveness of training for farmers.</P>
      <P><B>Matching social and cultural expectations</B></P>
      <P>Bowen and Carey (1990) indicate that training conducted without 
      appropriate consideration of the social and cultural aspects tends to have 
      limited long term effectiveness. Therefore, trainers must consider social 
      and cultural factors such as the village, friends, community, farm 
      organization, work group, family, cooperatives, and religion.</P>
      <P>Another issue is the timing of the training. If the training is not 
      scheduled at a time when the trainees can comfortably participate, it may 
      fail. If the trainees are not "ready" for the subject matter of the 
      training, they may reject it. Readiness of the learner is required for all 
      types of education.</P>
      <P>EXERCISES:</P>
      <P>1. Remember a training session in which you were a participant. How was 
      it organized? What did you like about the session(s)? What changes could 
      have been made to improve the training? Redesign the training using the 
      ideas from this module so the training is more effective and you would be 
      more comfortable.</P>
      <P>2. Choose a group that you want to train. Plan the training using the 
      ideas from this module. You should also look at the module on workshops 
      (TL-1) and perhaps some of the other modules on teaching/learning 
      techniques (they all have "TL" before the number).
