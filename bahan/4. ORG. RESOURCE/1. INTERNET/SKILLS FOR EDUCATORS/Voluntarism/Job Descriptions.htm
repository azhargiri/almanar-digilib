      <H2>Job Descriptions V-2</H2><I>
      <P align=center>The fires I have started cannot be put out by anyone 
      else</I>. </P>
      <P>For effective recruitment, orientation and supervision of volunteers 
      you need a job description. This is one of those details that people like 
      to skip. It takes a little time and thought about details -- not very 
      exciting -- but can make the exciting part go much better. Without a job 
      description for the volunteers with which you work, you may feel 
      overwhelmed and frustrated by the job of keeping volunteers going. The 
      volunteer may have the same feelings and decide to drop out.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVE</P>
      <P>When you complete this module you should be able to write a job 
      description for a volunteer in your educational program.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>EXERCISE:</B></P>
      <P>Study the following format for a job description. Then fill in the 
      information for each number in the format using a position which you need 
      to fill (if you are familiar with the job to be filled, this should 
      present no problems - - otherwise this can be done as a hypothetical job 
      description which is less effective than the real thing). Then use the 
      completed job description along with the module on recruitment (V-3) to 
      recruit a volunteer to fill the job.</P>
