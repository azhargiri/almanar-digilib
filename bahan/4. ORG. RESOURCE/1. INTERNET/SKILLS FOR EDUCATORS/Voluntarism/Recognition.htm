      <H2>Recognition V-8</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Sooner or later God will give everybody what they 
      deserve.</I> </P>
      <P>To be appreciated, to feel important and needed is a basic human need. 
      Encouragement and recognition are essential to human development and 
      motivation. Before looking at this module review the more general 
      discussion of motivation in module V-4.</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>When you finish this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Describe a range of actions that you can take to recognize 
      accomplishment.<BR>2. Describe how you will practice some of these 
      actions.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>WHY GIVE RECOGNITION?</H3>
      <P>According to world renowned management consultant Peter Druker, the 
      major cause of low productivity among today's workers is the lack of 
      meaningful recognition. "Failure to commend good performance is 
      management's single greatest mistake. Good performance that is 
      unrecognized deteriorates. When it comes to the managing of people, rarely 
      can there be too much positive, reinforcement. "In their best selling 
      book, The One Minute Manager, Blanchard and Johnson prescribe the use of 
      "One Minute Praisings" to inspire and motivate others. They recommend that 
      you: "Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they 
      are doing. Then catch them doing things right, and tell them about it in 
      no uncertain terms."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>HOW TO GIVE RECOGNITION</H3>
      <P>Your recognition-giving will be most effective if it is:</P>
      <P><B>Spontaneous</B>, expressed on the spot. The longer you wait, the 
      harder it will be to say, and the less effective the compliment becomes. 
      Say it now, rather than saving it for the annual recognition night.</P>
      <P><B>Sincere</B>. If you don't mean it, don't say it. If you try to 
      deceive, your non-verbal communication will give you away, and you will 
      end up sounding artificial and contrived.</P>
      <P><B>Specific.</B> Give attention to details. Unfortunately, much of our 
      recognition-giving consists of light weight "marshmallow compliments" that 
      are delayed, vague, and unconvincing, e.g., "It went well." "Good job." 
      Such compliments are nice, but really don't carry much weight, or have 
      much impact. Be specific in indicating exactly what the person did that 
      was so important, and why. Compliment the "little" as well as the "big" 
      things.</P>
      <P><B>Non-verbally reinforced.</B> A warm pat on the back, a wink, a 
      smile, an agreeing nod of the head, excitement in your eyes will more than 
      triple the impact of your words. The desired effect of praise can be 
      amplified (or negated) by how it is given.</P>
      <P>Compliment people's ideas as well as their actions. A major determinant 
      of our personal self- esteem is how others respond to our ideas, what we 
      say. Also, share your compliments with the "significant others" in that 
      person's life--his or her spouse, parents, superior, friends.</P>
      <P>Many of us have difficulty in freely praising others, and we make 
      excuses for not doing so, e.g., "they'll get a swollen head," or "people 
      should take pride in what they're doing and not need to be rewarded." Take 
      a close look at yourself, and how you are showing your appreciation to 
      others. Recognition is meaningful only if the people receiving it feel 
      important, needed and inspired as a result of your comments and actions. 
      If they don't, change your approach. Experiment with different forms of 
      recognition-giving until you find ones you feel comfortable with and that 
      work in motivating others. The better people feel about themselves, the 
      better they perform.</P>
      <P>Listening is also a form of recognition. Review module C-2 for a 
      discussion of specific listening techniques.</P>
