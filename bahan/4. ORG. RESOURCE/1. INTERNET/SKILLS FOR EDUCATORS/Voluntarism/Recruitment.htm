      <H2>Recruitment V-3</H2><I>
      <P align=center>In order to convince another person, we must see the world 
      through her eyes.</I> </P>
      <P>Getting people to support your cause by giving their time is an 
      on-going challenge for most groups. This module will provide pointers on 
      recruiting people to serve.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>1. Describe a three-step recruitment technique.</P>
      <P>2. Recruit another person to help with a specific task in your 
      organization.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3><B>GETTING PEOPLE TO SERVE</B></H3>
      <P>Getting people to turn out and to volunteer in filling needed positions 
      has become an increasing challenge for many groups. Several pointers are 
      listed below as part of a three-step process. While the following 
      principles are common sense, and are readily used in filling paid 
      positions, they are often violated in our recruiting efforts for volunteer 
      positions.</P>
      <P>STEP 1- WHAT</P>
      <P>In filling positions, whether it's getting turn out for a meeting or 
      selecting a committee chair, focus first on WHAT--what are the specific 
      skills, interests, view points, prior experiences, personality traits, and 
      resources needed. Make a list. Check the 2 or 3 most essential. At this 
      point, the important question is not who but what--what do we need on the 
      committee, what do we need in the chair, what do we need at the meeting to 
      make it effective? Recruitment will be easier and more effective if 
      preceded by a conscious, well-thought-out selection process.</P>
      <P>How do we usually recruit people to serve? We call for volunteers. 
      "Willingness to serve" often is our only criteria. Be cautious with this 
      approach. Calling for volunteers implies that the job is so unimportant 
      that the group is willing to accept anyone. Did you ever think of it this 
      way? No wonder few people volunteer. Also, when you call for volunteers 
      you often get the egocentric, the aggressive and the outspoken person with 
      a bone to pick. Then you wonder why you have leadership problems.</P>
      <P>Most people won't volunteer themselves. Yet we often insist that people 
      do so. Calling for volunteers eliminates from our consideration a large 
      pool of qualified individuals. This is not to say that you should never 
      call for volunteers. It is very appropriate for lesser positions, e.g., 
      "Who could work at the food booth Saturday?" Key positions, however, are 
      too important to be left to chance.</P>
      <P>STEP 2: WHO</P>
      <P>Once you've decided what, then ask yourself WHO--who (what person or 
      persons) can provide the essentials you've just identified. Your objective 
      is to match the needs of the position with the skills and interests of the 
      individual. Often we reverse these two steps. We decide who, and then 
      dream up reasons why they should serve. Our "pitch" comes across phony. 
      Clarify what is needed, and then identify who. Individuals tend to respond 
      favorably to an appeal to their unique abilities and interests.</P>
      <P>A 4-H leader, whose annual plea for an assistant received no response, 
      decided to try the above approach. He invited all parents to a meeting and 
      then handed out a list of the tasks with which he needed help if he were 
      to continue serving as 4-H leader. To his amazement, the group immediately 
      responded by volunteering themselves for specific tasks or recommending 
      others they felt would be well suited and interested.</P>
      <P>Having decided what is needed, and who would be well suited, you are 
      now, and only now, ready to recruit.</P>
      <P>STEP 3: RECRUITMENT</P>
      <P>In recruiting others, use a one-on-one, personal approach. Only then 
      can your personal commitment and enthusiasm show through. Mass appeals are 
      generally less effective.</P>
      <P>"But I don't have time to contact people personally" is often used as 
      an excuse for relying solely on mail-outs or mass media. If each member 
      would take only five minutes to contact one person, using this approach, 
      participation problems could be quickly reversed. The number one reason 
      people give for participating is "a friend (neighbor, family member) asked 
      me."</P>
      <P>Use a personal appeal; indicate in very specific terms what that person 
      would gain from joining the group or in serving in the position. Indicate 
      how that person's interests, hobbies, skills, prior experiences, contacts 
      and personality are well suited to the position. Use the information 
      gathered in the preceding what/who exercise. Relate to both the person's 
      altruistic and personal interests.</P>
      <P>A rule of thumb: If you can't readily identify at least three specific 
      personal reasons why the person being considered would want to 
      serve/participate (reasons that the person recognizes and values), don't 
      ask. Rather than target our appeal, many of us get lazy and use 
      generalized appeals, with limited results.</P>
      <P>Recruit with a clear, straightforward I-statement. "I would like (the 
      specific nature of the request) because.........(person's unique 
      qualifications and/or personal benefits that can be expected)." "I've 
      heard you complain about (suggest, express interest in).... We are 
      organizing a group to look into that. We'd like to invite you to join us." 
      "I'm familiar with your experience (abilities, knowledge) in.... We would 
      like your help in...." Avoid questions, e g., "Would you be willing 
      to...?"</P>
      <P>A librarian called several public meetings with very poor response, in 
      an attempt to form a local Friends of the Library. She then went through 
      the above three steps, selecting and then contacting 12 individuals. She 
      now has a large active organization.</P>
      <P>Clearly and honestly indicate what will be involved, how much time it 
      will take, and what is expected of the individual. Don't down play what is 
      involved. We often tell people, "It won't take much time," and then 
      complain afterwards when they don't give it much time.</P>
      <P>Clarify your expectations. People are reluctant to take on indefinite 
      tasks for indefinite periods of time. When your request includes a 
      specific time commitment, the response is often, "Oh, if that is what you 
      want, I can handle that." If you find everyone is turning you down, go 
      back to the drawing board and redefine the position to make it more 
      realistic and attractive.</P>
      <P>Be positive. Focus on what you feel are the personal benefits of 
      serving in the position. Convey your own enthusiasm and commitment to the 
      project. If you are not excited, it is hard to excite others. 
      Unintentionally, many people come across more negative than positive in 
      their efforts to recruit others. Some common examples of negative requests 
      are:</P>
      <P>"It's a thankless job, but somebody has to do it."</P>
      <P>"We've already asked six people, and no one else would do it."</P>
      <P>"It's not much of a job; you can handle it."</P>
      <P>"We all have to take our turn."</P>
      <P>In short, we make service sound like drudgery rather than fun. Avoid 
      "should" and "ought", and appeals to the person's moral and civic 
      responsibilities. Arm twisting and the use of guilt and shame can get a 
      person to say "yes," but rarely motivate commitment and follow-through. 
      Briefly make your spiel in a straightforward manner, and then stop and 
      listen. Allow the person the freedom to say "no."</P>
      <P>Practice. Think through how you are going to approach the individual, 
      before you do lt. Role play or use mental imagery to prepare for what 
      might happen.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the way you recruit clearly conveys how important you 
      feel the position is. Casual and careless recruitment will likely lead to 
      casual and careless participation. The process outlined advocates a 
      positive, well thought out, straightforward approach that makes the person 
      being recruited feel important and genuinely needed. It matches the needs 
      of the group with the talents, interests and concerns of potential 
      volunteers. Close adherence to these steps will result in a committed, 
      self-motivated group in contrast to an aimless group that needs constant 
      prodding. It can make recruitment a form of recognition rather than an 
      imposition.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE:</P>
      <P>Identify a need for a volunteer for your group or organization. Outline 
      a strategy for recruitment:</P>
      <P>1. clearly state the position or task to be filled;</P>
      <P>2. list all of the skills, knowledge, attitudes, experience, resources, 
      contacts, characteristics that you would like this person to have;</P>
      <P>3. write down the names of at least three candidates for the 
      position;</P>
      <P>4. pick the best candidate and write down three reasons why the 
      prospect should want to volunteer (from the prospect's point of view);</P>
      <P>5. rehearse and role play your statements to the prospect; and</P>
      <P>6. ask the group you are in (or a colleague) to evaluate your "pitch" 
      and tell you if it is positive, convincing, reasonable, clear and sincere.
