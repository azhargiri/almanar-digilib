      <P>Increasingly volunteer organizations are facing legal challenges and 
      the need to anticipate legal issues before situations occur.</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVE</P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should have identified important legal 
      issues for volunteer organizations. By identifying the issues you can

      <P>Some organizations, especially those involved in youth development, now 
      require all volunteers be screened at the local level for previous record 
      of criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Does your organization require volunteer screening? Who is responsible? 
      What is the process? Who must be screened? Are clearances from other 
      organizations valid for yours?</P>

      violating a code of conduct?</P>
      <P>3. Has the code of conduct been checked lately and brought up to 
      date?</P>

      Can anyone carry out any fund-raising event as long as it is legal?</P>
      <P>2. Is any clearance, permission, or notification required for 
      fund-raising?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>HANDLING MONEY</H3>
      <P>1. Does your organization have any guidelines for club treasurers?</P>
      <P>2. Who may open bank accounts? Under what conditions? Is a tax exempt

      <P>3. Is permission required for copies of handouts or audio-visual 
      software?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><I>Can you think of any other legal considerations that are relevant to 
      your organization or any of its programs or activities?</I></P>
      <P>EXERCISE:</P>
      <P>Check with your superiors if you have any doubt about any of the items 
      on the list above. If they aren't certain of the answer, suggest that they 
      check with legal counsel to clarify the question or issue. You may also 
      want to go over this list of issues with someone from another organization 
      which is similar to yours to see how they deal with legal issues. <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE><!--This file created 3:54 PM  2/9/99 by Claris Home Page version 3.0--></BODY></HTML>
