      <H2>Basic Human Needs V-1</H2><I>
      <P align=center>No bread is too hard when you are really hungry</I>. </P>
      <P>One of the theories most basic to nonformal education is Maslow's 
      hierarchy of basic human needs.</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After studying this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. List Maslow's five categories of basic human needs.<BR>2. Discuss 
      what each category means for planning educational programs.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>MASLOW'S HIERARCHY</H3>
      <P>Psychologist Abraham Maslow grouped the various motivating drives each 
      of us has into five categories:</P>
      <P>PHYSICAL NEEDS: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Income, health, shelter, sex, food, and sleep. </LI></UL>
      <P>SECURITY NEEDS: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Safety, continuing employment, healthy environment, freedom from 
        fear, anxiety and the threat of punishment. </LI></UL>
      <P>SOCIAL NEEDS: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Love, sense of belonging, atmosphere of acceptance, prestige, 
        recreation and entertainment. </LI></UL>
      <P>SELF-WORTH: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Ego satisfaction, a feeling of value and importance to others. The 
        desire to achieve and to be recognized for it. </LI></UL>
      <P>SELF-REALIZATION: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Personal growth, higher education, spiritual development, the drive 
        to realize and utilize one's potential capabilities, the desire to 
        contribute to the betterment of mankind. </LI></UL>
      <P>Maslow's hierarchy is often shown as a pyramid:</P>
      <P align=center><IMG alt="pyramid.bmp (33782 bytes)" height=146 
      src="Basic%20Human%20Needs_files/pyramid.gif" width=223> </P>
      <P>As shown by the illustration, there is a hierarchy of needs. Only when 
      the lower needs are satisfied will the higher level needs be felt. Once 
      lower needs are satisfied, they stop being strong motivating forces. The 
      priorities each of us places on these needs varies with time as lower 
      needs are met, and as we grow and mature as individuals. Likewise, the 
      behavior used to fulfill these needs varies from one individual to 
      another. For example, one person meets his or her economic needs through 
      farming, while another meets them through retail business. One person gets 
      recognition by being cooperative, while another gets recognition by being 
      disruptive.</P>
      <P>The important thing for groups to realize is that the real motivators 
      in most of us are the "higher level" needs: social needs, self-worth, and 
      self-realization. But we often forget this. In motivating others, we tend 
      to exaggerate the importance of economic rewards, food and entertainment, 
      intimidation, and arm twisting. On the other hand, we tend to 
      under-emphasize the importance of people's social and self-worth needs--to 
      be accepted by others, to accomplish something meaningful and be 
      recognized for it, to share ideas and be respected for them, and to 
      contribute to community betterment.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</P>
      <P>1. What significance does this theory have for classroom teachers?</P>
      <P>2. What significance does it have for nonformal educators (see modules 
      E-1 and E-3 if you need help distinguishing between formal and nonformal 
      education)?</P>
      <P>3. Can you think of educational programs (or activities) that have 
      violated this theory?</P>
      <P>4. Why is this theory considered to be one of the most basic theories 
      for educators?
