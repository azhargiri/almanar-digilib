      <H2>Orientation V-5</H2><I>
      <P align=center>Experience gives advice.</I> </P>
      <P>Orientation is sometimes called "preservice training." It refers to the 
      process of imparting basic skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary for a 
      person to successfully complete assigned or chosen tasks.</P>
      <P>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>After finishing this module you should be able to:</P>
      <P>1. Plan an orientation workshop for a group of volunteers entering an 
      organization with which you are familiar.<BR>2. Evaluate the orientation 
      workshop.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3>PLANNING THE ORIENTATION WORKSHOP</H3>
      <P>Include volunteers throughout this process--both experienced volunteers 
      who know what is necessary to do the job, and the volunteers to be 
      trained. Use a job description (module V-2) to help you focus the training 
      and to include as a possible workshop topic.</P>
      <P><B>Identify issues:</B> What knowledge, skills and attitudes are needed 
      by the volunteers to be successful at their tasks? Do not neglect social 
      skills. The tendency is to focus on skills, but a misplaced attitude can 
      damage the effectiveness of a skilled volunteer.</P>
      <P><B>Set priorities:</B> Answer these questions. Which of the issues 
      (above)</P>
      <P>(1) are most essential?<BR>(2) do the volunteers lack most?<BR>(3) do 
      the volunteers need to build their confidence?</P>
      <P><B>Select topics:</B> these will come out of the issues and priorities 
      but may include (1) mission and philosophy of the organization, (2) the 
      job description, (3) how to recruit participants and helpers, (4) how to 
      obtain the cooperation of resource people, (5) how to obtain facilities, 
      (6) where to find teaching aids and other resources, (7) how to use 
      certain teaching techniques or methods, (8) how to assess the needs of the 
      participants, (9) how to determine the norms and values of participants, 
      and (10) where to get more technical subject matter related to the job. 
      Avoid detailed topics, advanced technical information, and topics already 
      taught unless requested by the participants.</P>
      <P><B>Goals and objectives:</B> These can be either short-term (the 
      effects on the volunteers immediately following the training) or long-term 
      (the effects that this training will have in the program over the next 
      several months or longer). The objectives should be observable and 
      measurable. Determine how to evaluate whether these goals and objectives 
      have been met (see module E-10 for help).</P>
      <P><B>Assess resources:</B> Look at resources both within the organization 
      and from without. Don't forget that the volunteers being trained have 
      access to resources, and are themselves resources. What experiences and 
      abilities do these volunteers have?</P>
      <P><B>Form a plan:</B> Write a detailed schedule of who will do what and 
      when (starting and ending time for each presenter or activity.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>--plan to teach larger tasks as a series of smaller ones.<BR>--take 
        into account knowledge, skills and attitudes currently held by the 
        volunteers.<BR>--use a variety of methods and techniques.<BR>--teach 
        only competencies (skills, knowledge, attitudes) that will be put to use 
        within a very short time.<BR>--make the length of the workshop 
        sufficient, but not burdensome.<BR>--teach basic, not in-depth, 
        material.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><B>IMPLEMENTING THE WORKSHOP</B></P>
      <P><B>Work the plan: </B>Use the written plan to guide the orientation. 
      Put it into effect in a comfortable setting, at a convenient time, 
      referring constantly to the plan.</P>
      <P><B>Motivation</B>. The motivation level of the volunteers will be 
      maintained or increased if the following are included in the 
      orientation.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>--Reinforce reasons to participate.<BR>--Recognize the 
        accomplishments of other volunteers.<BR>--Reinforce your goals and 
        objectives.<BR>--Conduct stimulating meetings.<BR>--Reduce risks of 
        participation by increasing their skill and confidence.<BR>--Provide an 
        opportunity for the trainer to listen to the volunteers--their questions 
        and ideas.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><B>Who should do the training?</B> Whoever is most qualified. 
      Qualification, however, should not be limited to academic degrees or 
      administrative titles. Previous workshop evaluations might be used to 
      select trainers. Current trends are for more participatory training--less 
      training designed and delivered by outside experts. More control by 
      trainees is more cost- effective, more motivating and more effective, in 
      most cases, than the traditional expert-oriented approach.</P>
      <P><B>Where and when should the training be held?</B> Convenience to the 
      trainees should be a primary concern. Facilities should be comfortable and 
      allow for flexibility. A location which creates an informal feeling and 
      encourages trainees to get actively involved is best. Timing is important 
      as well. Convenience to the trainees is, again, the principle criterion. 
      The nature of the orientation topics might also be important. Volunteers 
      need to receive orientation before they are expected to do the work, but 
      not so far in advance that they forget or lose enthusiasm.</P>
      <P><B>Duration of the training program.</B> This varies according to the 
      subject matter, the available resources, the time frame required for 
      learning, and the commitment of the trainees. Longer sessions require more 
      planning for variety and motivation. Long lectures are particularly 
      deadly. Provide for a change in activity or speaker every 20-30 minutes to 
      avoid boredom.</P>
      <P><B>The ideal number of trainees.</B> Usually trainers and those who 
      plan training programs have limited control of the number of trainees. 
      Large groups require different teaching/learning techniques and prevent 
      much individual contact with the trainer. Large groups can be broken into 
      smaller groups for skill practice. Experience from small group work 
      indicates that 5-7 is a good size for discussion that involves all members 
      or for skill practice where each participant must reach a minimum level of 
      competence.</P>
      <P><B>Resources and facilities. </B>These will also vary according to the 
      orientation plan. Look at module L-3 for tips on effective meetings and 
      module LT-1 (workshops) to anticipate resource and facility needs. Don't 
      forget to consider the following categories of resources in the 
      orientation plan:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>--personnel (trainers, clerical staff, helpers for meals, 
        drivers).<BR>--equipment (audio visuals, models, camera, lab 
        equipment).<BR>--materials (handouts, packets, evaluation forms, 
        transparencies, newsprint, tape, markers, pencils, note paper for 
        participants).<BR>--facilities (meeting room, breakout rooms, sites to 
        visit, food and lodging, transportation)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EVALUATING THE ORIENTATION</P>
      <P>Consider four areas to be evaluated: (1) physical elements such as the 
      facilities, time, schedule; (2) the instructor's preparation and skill; 
      (3) the material covered; and (4) the effect on the trainees. Below is an 
      evaluation instrument which you can use for your orientation. It can also 
      be used as a base to plan an evaluation which better suits your needs.</P>
      <P>Evaluation for _______________ Orientation</P>
      <P>___1. The setting was comfortable.</P>
      <P>___2. The instructor answered questions or referred us to people who 
      could.</P>
      <P>___3. The participants expressed more confidence than before this 
      orientation.</P>
      <P>___4. The instructor was knowledgeable about the program in which the 
      volunteers will serve.</P>
      <P>___5. The instructor was knowledgeable about the material covered.</P>
      <P>___6. The material was at a level appropriate to the participants.</P>
      <P>___7. The training was relevant to the jobs of these volunteers.</P>
      <P>___8. The time required for the training was not excessive.</P>
      <P>___9. The pace of the program was appropriate.</P>
      <P>___10. The program was interesting and varied.</P>
      <P>___11. The objectives of the orientation program were met.</P>
      <P>___12. The sessions stimulated ideas to help me do my job.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>EXERCISE:</P>
      <P>Plan an orientation session for new volunteers in your organization. Do 
      this in a study group which can critique your plan, or work with a partner 
      to critique the plan.</P>
      <P>Conduct and evaluate the orientation that you have planned. <!--msnavigation--></P></TD></TR><!--msnavigation--></TBODY></TABLE><!--This file created 3:52 PM  2/9/99 by Claris Home Page version 3.0--></BODY></HTML>
